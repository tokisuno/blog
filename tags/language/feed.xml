      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent a long time trying to learn Japanese, but at one point during the summer and this past academic year I really slacked on grammar. I had plenty of reasons to take a step back from it &amp;ndash; I had a lot going on in my personal life which prevented me from having any mental capacity to focus. However, that isn&amp;rsquo;t the case anymore, so I believe it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to pick myself up by the bootstraps and go back to learning Japanese!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
