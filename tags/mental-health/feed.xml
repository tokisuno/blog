      <title>Living with OCD</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I constantly rub my fingers together because if I don&amp;rsquo;t it feels like the world is ending. I constantly rub my hands together to make sure that they have the right feeling. If they don&amp;rsquo;t I have to go wash my hands or rub them more to itch my brain. When I cross the street, I have to hit the button 10 times, otherwise my brain isn&amp;rsquo;t convinced that I hit it. I often loose count, so restart over, and over, and over again. I blink harder than I should to get the feeling of not blinking out of my frontal lobe. I sometimes binge-eat in fear of not eating enough, or because I&amp;rsquo;ve accidentally starved myself again out of being scared to get food. Everything feels dirty so I avoid using my hands when I think it&amp;rsquo;s unnecessary. I move around and rock back-and-fourth in my chair because I can&amp;rsquo;t sit still. I always feel uncomfortable. I have nervous ticks because of this, which lead to my lips being bitten so much they sometimes turn bloodied, the skin on my thumbs bleeding, and the joints on my wrists, fingers, and toes being in pain from overuse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Weekly Blog Posts &#43; OCD</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something sparked in my brain. Although I don&amp;rsquo;t make basically any content on YouTube at the moment, I have a lot of scripts that I have lying around that after a few minor tweaks, will be good to be recorded. With that being said, I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying that for almost a year now and last year I really didn&amp;rsquo;t pump out as much as I wanted to. So to combat that, I will continue not uploading that much and make weekly blog posts! LOL&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New Year Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://tokisuno.github.io/blog/posts/20240103/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently released a video where I briefly covered how my 2024 went and what I wanted to accomplish going into the new year. All of what I said in that video is true, but I wanted to make a blog post that really goes into what I want to accomplish, why I want to do it, and methods I can see myself taking. This is all for my own personal accountability, and isn&amp;rsquo;t to be taken as a guide. This also isn&amp;rsquo;t to be taken as promise either, as I can&amp;rsquo;t tell what the future holds for me. This is more of a staple and/or a reminder that I can plan appropriately for when I need to, so when I do feel lost I have something to look back to this year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Friends</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;last edited: 2023-07-31&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;its-difficult&#34;&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s difficult&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For as long as I could remember, making friends has been somewhat of a struggle for me. People who know me will 100% attest to this, since from the outside I am a pretty sociable person, good, and pretty known around. I think the word one would use is &amp;ldquo;popular&amp;rdquo;, but this means absolutely nothing to me. In reality, trying to make any sort of connection is very difficult for me. Trauma, being neurodivergent, and having low self-confidence all plays a role in this, and has caused me to make major mistakes with those around me. It&amp;rsquo;s normally me messing up, and trying to make good. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten better at that. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten good at owning up to my mistakes, and trying to push through to correct what was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bloat</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-world-is-bloated&#34;&gt;the world is bloated&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really care to pay attention to this for the longest time. However, since moving over to Linux, I&amp;rsquo;ve become more aware on what I would consider to be bloat. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t just apply to using Linux. This applies to all OSes around the world, running any web-browser available. The web is bloated, and it&amp;rsquo;s really annoying. But what does it mean when a website is bloated?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Scattered Life</title>
      <link>https://tokisuno.github.io/blog/posts/20230527/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;introduction&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is pretty obvious that I love tech. I love creating, I love tinkering with things, I love making things, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s just been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really think much of it until last where, when I realized how much tech has evolved within my short life, and how much of an impact it has made on me. It also made me realize how much time it consumed and how obsessed I was with it. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t just tech. It spread to social media and latched onto my brain like some sort of parasite. The issue isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily with social media, rather with the relationship I had with it. It started with me going on YouTube a lot, refreshing my home page and waiting for someone&amp;rsquo;s new video to drop, or going down some sort of rabbit hole. This in turn created horrible habits including chronic cell phone use and severe sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Not-So-Unique Experience with Focus</title>
      <link>https://tokisuno.github.io/blog/posts/20230521/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;preface&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post is mainly focusing on my journey with my attention problems, where they stem from, how I&amp;rsquo;ve been managing them, and where I stand today. There are topics in here that may trigger some people (i.e. eating disorder &amp;amp; ocd) so read as you want. My story with focus and improvement has only started and is far from being over. It isn&amp;rsquo;t unique, it isn&amp;rsquo;t crazy, and it&amp;rsquo;s more common than you&amp;rsquo;d think. I&amp;rsquo;m not some sort of self-improvement guru. I am a 21 year old university student who makes youtube videos and sometimes posts to this blog. I am still struggling with focus along with a multitude of other things that I won&amp;rsquo;t make public. We all struggle, and we aren&amp;rsquo;t alone in it, no matter how much you/your brain tells you so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Motivation</title>
      <link>https://tokisuno.github.io/blog/posts/20230505/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-dont-believe-in-it&#34;&gt;i don&amp;rsquo;t believe in it.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know that may come off as strong, and it&amp;rsquo;s not that I don&amp;rsquo;t believe in motivation in of itself. I believe motivation is real, trust me. We&amp;rsquo;ve all experienced the sudden 3am &amp;ldquo;I am going to change the world&amp;rdquo; type of motivation, or the &amp;ldquo;I am going to turn my grades around and finally do all of those overdue assignments&amp;rdquo; type of motivation. It&amp;rsquo;s honestly super common among peers of mine, and people I see in passing. It&amp;rsquo;s not like they don&amp;rsquo;t know they&amp;rsquo;re essentially self sabotaging themselves. Hell, they embrace it and make it part of their personality. I find this to be extremely toxic and harmful in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
