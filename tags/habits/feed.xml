      <title>My Reading Goals -- Update!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those who are unaware, I had a reading goal for this year of 35 minutes. Now, the year hasn&amp;rsquo;t ended yet so I can still make it back, but I want to make it clear that I am not sad or disappointed in myself. This post isn&amp;rsquo;t to make excuses for myself because quite frankly, I feel really good about this year so far! I still have a physical illness that affects me daily, so audio content has helped me through a lot. I have been listening to a lot more podcasts and live-plays these days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;identity&#34;&gt;Identity&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been no surprise to anyone that I haven&amp;rsquo;t been uploading anything lately, and a big portion of that is due to insecurity. I want to preface this article by emphasizing this isn&amp;rsquo;t being posted for the sake of garnering sympathy. I find it therapeutic to write about my inner thoughts and post it online. This blog obviously isn&amp;rsquo;t comprised of my deepest most inner thoughts &amp;ndash; you guys aren&amp;rsquo;t my therapist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is kind of a continuation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://tokisuno.rocks/posts/20240419/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s never the right tool for the job&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is kind of a rough read. I don&amp;rsquo;t normally do in-depth editing on these posts, so if I contradict anything I say please just tell me and I&amp;rsquo;ll update the article&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post is going to be written very bluntly. I am writing this from the perspective of someone who has both read self-help and has tried a multitude of different apps/services in the name of &amp;ldquo;improving myself&amp;rdquo;. I have seen is both help and destroy productivity, and I think people often get disillusioned with doing what other more-successful people are doing because it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo;. But when they see another successful person doing something else, they hop on that, and then the next guy, and then the next guy&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Avoiding clocks â€¢ Obsession with Numbers</title>
      <link>https://tokisuno.github.io/blog/posts/20240522/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will most likely make a video on this, so for those who read the blog consider this an early-access version ;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this sounds extreme or not, but personally having a clock in my line of vision at all times while studying kills productivity. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if others feel the same, but personally if I have a clock and the date near by I won&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking about it. It boils down to my OCD and letting the numbers take control in my head, so I will briefly explain my thought process and the steps I take.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>3 Daily Habits for 2024</title>
      <link>https://tokisuno.github.io/blog/posts/20240511/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After reading &amp;ldquo;The Inner Game of Tennis&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Atomic Habits&amp;rdquo; for the first time, I started trusting myself more than ever before. The results came with it too, as I was able to perform well and improve in anything I put my mind to at a rate I had never experienced before. Then, life hit and slowly but surely to mask my true feelings, I started falling back into old habits. These old habits mainly involve self-disparaging comments which at first, were just jokes! I knew who I was better than anyone else, so me saying this things like how I used to should be fine, right? &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
