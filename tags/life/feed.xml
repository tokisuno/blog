      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well this was supposed to be out earlier this week, but quite frankly I forgot and was really tired from the weekend of gaming I just had.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;goml-forever&#34;&gt;GOML Forever&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GOML is a yearly Super Smash Brothers Melee tournament I go to, and it&amp;rsquo;s honestly one of my highlights of every year. I love GOML. It has done so much for me. I&amp;rsquo;ve met many cool people going to the tournament, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen many iconic moments in person, and I&amp;rsquo;ve met a lot of the people I&amp;rsquo;ve looked up to. I&amp;rsquo;ve somehow managed to be a small part of a smaller community that I hold so dearly to my heart. For the past two years, I have been volunteering at the event helping run pools (sections of a double elimination bracket) and it&amp;rsquo;s always really fun. I do obviously have moments where I fall behind schedule and sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s just out of my content (infinite floaties being sent to my pool) and honestly that&amp;rsquo;s fine. It&amp;rsquo;s all part of the experience. I love Melee and I love gaming. I love the environment. In person gaming is something you have to experience if you never have before. It&amp;rsquo;s like live sporting but nerdier and depending on the scene, smellier. I am glad to say that the Melee community does a pretty good job with personal hygiene and I did not have a single sweaty-smelling person experience the entire event.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction--what-is-this&#34;&gt;Introduction :: What is this?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every Tuesday is now marked down in my calendar for a weekly blog post to keep the creative writing muscles flowing. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been writing much in all honesty, so this is just one way I can keep at this. I am notoriously bad at keeping a rhythm as of recent, but I have to try and change that for the betterment of my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the mid-2025 life update! So far we&amp;rsquo;re through half of the year, and I thought it would be a good idea to write out what&amp;rsquo;s been going on for me so far, what&amp;rsquo;s changed, and what&amp;rsquo;s the relative feeling right now. I will like to preface this post by saying it&amp;rsquo;s not the most uplifting nor is it the most inspiring. I honestly haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten a lot done, especially over the past month since my previous partner broke up with me. I don&amp;rsquo;t want sympathy or any witch-hunting by any means. I know my channel is small enough that this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t happen anyways, but I always want to put it out there incase we have any bad-faith actors. Don&amp;rsquo;t be cringe please.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
