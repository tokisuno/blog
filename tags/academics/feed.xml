      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love Linguistics. I think Linguistics is such an ever-changing integral part of our existence that we don&amp;rsquo;t give enough proper attention to as a society. We overlook how our words and speech affect aspects of the real world, and how we view things. I really enjoy linguistics, but there&amp;rsquo;s always that nagging voice in my head that tells me I&amp;rsquo;ve made the wrong choice, and that&amp;rsquo;s what I want to talk about now. I am 22 years old, 4th year undergraduate, and struggling with my identity in my field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; I did say that I was going to do weekly posts, and I am back to say that I&amp;rsquo;m going back to doing those. When I initially said that, I was going through a lot of personal stuff and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to figure out how my git repos actually worked, so I mental boomed and didn&amp;rsquo;t post to here for a hot minute. It turns out all I had to do was switch branches in my public repo, and then push new commits, and now everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
