      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do NOT condone what Mang0 did. I also think that although Ludwig did give a good response to what happened, really crossed over calling it what it was on stream: sexual assault. Mang0 going around the Beerio Kart venue to women who were streaming and air-humping them/humping objects close to their faces and bodies is sexual assault. Mang0 is a husband (I think? I am still unsure if he ever got married) and has a child that looks up to him. He knows it&amp;rsquo;s inexcusable, and although he did a &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; job expressing this in the second twitter apology, this is something that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have happened in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
