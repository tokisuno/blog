<p>I do NOT condone what Mang0 did. I also think that although Ludwig did give a good response to what happened, really crossed over calling it what it was on stream: sexual assault. Mang0 going around the Beerio Kart venue to women who were streaming and air-humping them/humping objects close to their faces and bodies is sexual assault. Mang0 is a husband (I think? I am still unsure if he ever got married) and has a child that looks up to him. He knows it&rsquo;s inexcusable, and although he did a <em>better</em> job expressing this in the second twitter apology, this is something that shouldn&rsquo;t have happened in the first place.</p>

<p>Mang0 at the time of writing this is 33 years old.</p>
