<h1 id="oopsies">Oopsies</h1>
<p>Sorry for not posting for some time without saying anything, but there have been some exciting things going on in my personal life that I&rsquo;ve been working through and saving to share for a later date.</p>
<h1 id="i-have-a-job">I have a job!</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to get into the specifics of it, but I have a job now! This means I will now be making stable income in order to invest back into content and my future education. It&rsquo;s just a part-time position since, in all honesty, I don&rsquo;t know if my body can handle a full-time position atm. I don&rsquo;t have that physical energy. But now I actually have something to do that&rsquo;s outside of content creation, which I think in turn will end up being really helpful for my future. Now I have something else aside from just sitting at home getting 300 steps a day.</p>
<h1 id="plans-of-going-back-to-university">Plans of going back to University</h1>
<p>This is still something I&rsquo;m asking around about and getting more information on, but I do plan on going back to Uni in the next 2 years or so. My current life plan is to get into some kind of CS/SWE degree with Co-op so I can find some sort of good paying job, and save to live comfortably. My parents plan on leaving some time in the next 5-10 years, which means I have to be able to live independently without their support, or be on that path by the time they leave. This sense of urgency has given me some new motivation to pursue something more in the tech space.</p>
<h1 id="my-honest-feelings-towards-csswe">My honest feelings towards CS/SWE</h1>
<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve talked quite a bit about, but I&rsquo;ll just repeat this again. I was actually going to go to another University in Ontario for CS before I had a major falling-out with my parents. I was tired and burned out, and although they had their best intentions and they just really wanted me to succeed, it kind of pushed me to resent everything I was doing. That&rsquo;s not to say that they weren&rsquo;t valid in their concerns. Historically, I am someone who hasn&rsquo;t been good at taking the initiative and going above-and-beyond. I&rsquo;ve only been forced to, or have had to due to external pressure. It&rsquo;s never really been by my own volition. So I broke. Something in me mentally snapped, and I just completely neglected CS and programming from then on, until 2nd year Uni when I started getting into Linux and Vim.</p>
<p>Now I have fallen back down the problem-solving programming rabbit-hole and I think now that I am more mature and have more life experience, I can actually say with confidence that I can excel in a difficult degree like CS/SWE. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m passionate about, and since I am 23, I don&rsquo;t really have to worry about the whole social aspect and whatnot that comes with being a first year student. I already have a degree. I am on a different path in life as probably everyone else in the program I&rsquo;d be applying to. That&rsquo;s really appealing to me.</p>
<p>The more I sort of work on personal projects, the more I realize that what I am doing is basically what people study SWE for. I am really terrible at managing projects, and planning on a broader scale. This is something that a degree would instill into me, and with the added bonus of Co-op, I can work hard enough and stand out enough to actually have a good chance of getting what I want.</p>
<p>I think this is all to say that I am a very different person now than I was at 18 during COVID, and thanks to the people around me and those who have inspired me (hey jaemes), I honestly think this is something I can push myself to strive for.</p>
<p>Also, a little known fact about me, my paternal grandfather was an engineer! My dad wear&rsquo;s his ring to this day.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for this little update. I do have two videos in the works right now, but it&rsquo;s a lot of subtitling and planning, so once I&rsquo;m done work for the week I&rsquo;ll focus more on that. Thanks for reading!</p>
