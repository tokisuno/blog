<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I recently released a video where I briefly covered how my 2024 went and what I wanted to accomplish going into the new year. All of what I said in that video is true, but I wanted to make a blog post that really goes into what I want to accomplish, why I want to do it, and methods I can see myself taking. This is all for my own personal accountability, and isn&rsquo;t to be taken as a guide. This also isn&rsquo;t to be taken as promise either, as I can&rsquo;t tell what the future holds for me. This is more of a staple and/or a reminder that I can plan appropriately for when I need to, so when I do feel lost I have something to look back to this year.</p>
<p>I am going to structure reach of these 5 goals as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reasoning (理由)</li>
<li>Preparation (準備)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was originally writing this out in a Google Doc (yes, I still use it for some things), and I realized how much better this would be as a blog post instead. So here we are! These are 4 things I really want to work on going into 2024 :p</p>
<h2 id="be-more-disconnected">Be more disconnected</h2>
<h3 id="reasoning">Reasoning</h3>
<p>For those unaware, I have had a lot of physical health issues throughout the last 3 months that are only now fading away (thank god). This caused me to reset a lot of the previous progress that I had made with my productivity and mental health throughout these months/years. I would rely more on technological crutches and other means of entertainment in order to make the time I spent being &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; feel not as bad. Obviously this goes without saying that I wasn&rsquo;t actually being lazy. I was healing and resting from battling with sickness, but I wanted to find some way to stimulate my brain that studying did and couldn&rsquo;t at the time do. So with that being said, I want to take some steps back to be less online.</p>
<h3 id="preparation">Preparation</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To get a hold of my time again, I have gone back to using my Qin Phone F21 Pro. This in of itself deserves a whole other blog post/write up, but tl;dr the main issue I had with it got fixed so I&rsquo;m back to it. I also had problems setting proper to-do lists for the day. I am still in the process of moving my authentication and emails over to the phone, but this is all to get away from my iPhone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of my iPhone, since I was sick for a hot minute, I re-installed a lot of apps again. Now this might sound crazy, but I am going to stick with having <strong>some</strong> of them installed. There are some features on Instagram that make communication easier with people, so I am keeping that. Everything else goes though, since I have no reason to have them installed. That includes YouTube and Reddit (my two worst time-wasters).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am going to start meditation. I did it once and I felt really good after it, so I have no idea why I never did it again. Maybe I got lost in this fast-paced world, but nevertheless I&rsquo;ll get back into it. I used to do it by listening to a metric fuck ton of Alan Watts lectures I had installed, and just closing my eyes and listening to what he was saying. I&rsquo;d also close my eyes and listen to my own breaths, but since I essentially plagued my brain with distraction and stimulation over these past months I haven&rsquo;t been as successful with it as I&rsquo;d like. Getting this down pat again will really help me stay disconnected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a reading goal of 50 books for 2024, and those 50 books aren&rsquo;t going to read themselves LMAO.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="reset-my-learning-process">Reset my learning process</h2>
<h3 id="reasoning-1">Reasoning</h3>
<p>Due to my sickness and relapsing into a lot of bad habits, my learning process has been messed up. I used to be really good at being mindful and trusting the inner methods, but before the end of the summer I had a big falling out with someone which led to be isolating myself from friends. I went to a lot of therapy, but only halfway through the summer. I became a lot more negative, cynical, and judgemental. I would jokingly make self-deprecating jokes and &ldquo;get mad&rdquo; to get a reaction out of people while playing games. But that self-manifested into my real life, and only got worse during these past 3 months. I fell victim to myself again and it&rsquo;s created this huge barricade in my mental learning process.</p>
<h3 id="preparation-1">Preparation</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I am going to re-read The Inner Game of Tennis, and take notes on it again. The only reason I&rsquo;m choosing this book is due to its size and relatively easy-to-understand language. It&rsquo;s pretty short and I recommend it to anyone who&rsquo;s willing to learn more about themselves. This book was what originally got me back into reading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Journalling has proven to be a very valuable skill. Since I stopped journalling, I found my awareness and compassion of myself and my action to decrease a lot, and I coped with it by telling myself &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it later&rdquo; or &ldquo;Now&rsquo;s not the time&rdquo; which can snowball over time (and it did). Through journalling, I find my overall mindfulness to go up, and self-compassion grows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the hardest part of this process, but it&rsquo;s being less hard on myself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="take-better-notes">Take better notes</h2>
<h3 id="reasoning-2">Reasoning</h3>
<p>I have been taking notes on and off for some years now, and I honestly don&rsquo;t have an effective note-taking method. I have tried a lot of different mediums of note-taking but not any specific methods. I have looked at Zettelkasten in the past but it wasn&rsquo;t for me, and I never actually put it into action. Either way, I want to create some sort of good knowledge-base/wiki that I can use to refer back to when furthering my studies.</p>
<h3 id="preparation-2">Preparation</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book that someone in my local smash scene recommended (shoutout to Guy Dino SSBM Toronto sexyman) on discord so I&rsquo;ll go ahead and read that. I will also be more proactive with how I take notes and refer back to them by blocking all distracting sites during study periods and utilizing Anki more. I found a way to use Anki to make cards wherever I am on my PC (global hotkey type beat) and I played around with it during last term. I will go back to using that again.</p>
<h2 id="take-my-health-seriously">Take my health seriously</h2>
<h3 id="reasoning-3">Reasoning</h3>
<p>During my alone-time summer, I spent a lot of time thinking and fortifying my mental health. But something very important I neglected was my physical health and well-being. I have really bad seasonal allergies which definitely makes my quality of life lesser. There are lots of foods that I can&rsquo;t eat because they cause severe irritation and swelling to my throat &ndash; not enough to be fatal but enough to cause a false allergic reaction. This is called OAS (Oral Allergy Syndrome). Because of this, I have been too scared to eat a lot of foods in fear of having a false allergic reaction that ruins my day. I&rsquo;ve become weaker, I&rsquo;ve eaten less and started eating more food from outside. I don&rsquo;t want to live like this anymore.</p>
<p>I also got really sick after getting a concussion at the beginning of October which completely threw all my life and previous planning into the trash. It caused a lot of other health complications which I am still dealing with which could have been sorted out earlier had I seen a professional right after it happened. It&rsquo;s made living very uncomfortable and is a big reason for why I go to the washroom so much during my streams.</p>
<p>I was going to mention running in this post, but I have a problem with my nose where whenever I inhale through it for some small period of time consistently I start to get headaches. This could be due to multiple different factors that I have to go to the doctors for. But until then, extended running is off the table</p>
<p><em>(but long walks continue &gt;:3)</em></p>
<h3 id="preparation-3">Preparation</h3>
<p>This will probably be the longest part because I really need to improve here LMAO.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Meal planning is going to be absolutely vital in this. I have been afraid of cooking for a long time, but I can&rsquo;t live like this forever. I will conquer my fear of cooking and start planning my meals. This means that I will be able to eat foods that I can actually enjoy (without discomfort) and live an overall healthier life. I will commit to cooking at least once a week starting from when this goes up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will start doing daily 15 minute stretches. I think this goes without saying but sitting in front of a computer in a chair all day isn&rsquo;t good for anyone&rsquo;s health. I go to the gym with my friends from time to time but it&rsquo;s nothing consistent. I have some weights in my room that I never touch. I want to start with something basic and easy to get into, so doing stretches seems pretty ideal for that first hurtle. I do live in discomfort a lot of the time, and this is due to my joints being pretty shit due to my lifestyle. Stretching will help fix that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is probably going to sound kind of cringe, but I used to do 10-15 pushups a day just to get exercise in. I stopped doing it around the time I got concussed and haven&rsquo;t gone back, so doing light pushups like before will hopefully prove to be valuable in the future. Any sort of exercise is good for me at this point.</p>
</li>
</ol>
