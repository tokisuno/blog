<h1 id="welcome">Welcome!</h1>
<p>Welcome back to another week of Toki Talks! This week, I just want to shout out some old usernames of people I used to know/watch as a child. I hope that this page can be indexed online one day and I can either get in contact with some of lesser-known guys from my childhood, or maybe talk to some people who also watched these growing up :) <em>This isn&rsquo;t an extensive list by any means, as I know there are a lot of people from art communities I used to be a part of that were either exposed, have changed names, have changed genders, and don&rsquo;t want to be mentioned most likely to put their name to rest.</em></p>
<h1 id="the-lists">The lists</h1>
<h2 id="lego-customs">Lego Customs</h2>
<p>But these examples are like, the tip top of the people that inspired me to make content. Along the way, I have been in and out of many communities. The first real online community I was a part of was the Lego Customs community of the early 2010s. Prominent members of that time included:</p>
<ul>
<li>MrOrangeLego</li>
<li>GabbaGabbaStudios</li>
<li>TehSupahSmasher (EpicLegoCustoms528) &lt;&ndash; my first online friend</li>
<li>SonicSimon</li>
</ul>
<p>The community and scene has grown a lot since then, and basically no one here makes content anymore. It&rsquo;s of an era long passed, but I am sure there after me writing this post, I&rsquo;m going to receive a message one day from someone who was also deep-diving to find these people and say &ldquo;oh wow, I can&rsquo;t believe I found someone else who watched them!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="lets-plays">Let&rsquo;s Plays!</h2>
<p>I used to love watching LPs as a kid, a lot. But when looking back at some of the creators I used to watch, some of them have just faded with time and were never actually super big creators like I remembered. Just remember that the names I am mentioning here are people I watched in 2012-2013, and I haven&rsquo;t watched their videos in over a decade. So if anyone goes and watches a video, and hears something they don&rsquo;t like, don&rsquo;t get mad at me LMAO.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yohhamgambal</li>
<li>PlayingWithMahWii</li>
</ul>
<p>I was obviously also really into Chuggaaconroy and remember fondly watching TheRunawayGuys&rsquo; LP of New Super Mario Bros Wii and Smash 64. I think it&rsquo;s because I really enjoyed watching other people having fun with their friends, as I couldn&rsquo;t really do that for the longest time with gaming. I was an only child, and even when playing online with friends it&rsquo;s just not the same. There&rsquo;s something special about gaming in person with people you know and love.</p>
<h2 id="mcsg-kohi-minecraft-pvp">MCSG, Kohi, Minecraft PVP</h2>
<p>Okay this list is going to be a lot longer, but these are the MCSG boys I used to follow</p>
<ul>
<li>Huahwi</li>
<li>PoisonousApple</li>
<li>DiamondsCraftMC &lt;&ndash; was my fav back in the day</li>
<li>MorphedCaliber</li>
<li>Solrflare</li>
<li>KvnPlays &lt;&ndash; used to harass him on ask.fm in 2015</li>
<li>JustAHotdog</li>
<li>Cscoop &lt;&ndash; has made a video indirectly calling me out before</li>
<li>BiboyQG</li>
<li>ItsAustenn</li>
<li>GoldenEllipse</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, these are just the guys I used to watch on a semi-regular basis. I was ADDICTED to MCSG. For Kohi I really only watched Stimpy. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for this week. Hopefully this was entertaining to some of you. Thanks for watching :3</p>
