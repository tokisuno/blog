<h1 id="personal-accountability">Personal accountability</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a lot of reflection over the past few days about my life, where I am, and how unhappy I am with it. I&rsquo;ve been slowly digging myself a deeper hole by not taking personal accountability for my own actions and how I handle things. I spend a lot of time on my phone either doom-scrolling or playing Balatro. I spend a lot of time watching YouTube on my phone instead of just being in the moment. I have fallen back onto those vices in order to get me through the day. Then earlier this week, I folded and gave into watching a Dr. K video. This shouldn&rsquo;t be something you fold into, but I have problems accepting reality at times and avoid responsibility for as long as I can. I listened to a video of his on why so many men don&rsquo;t grow up, and I feel like a lot of that video felt like it either directly related to me, or I was getting there. I don&rsquo;t want to get there and I don&rsquo;t want to make things worse for myself. I haven&rsquo;t been studying super hard. I&rsquo;ve honestly been living on autopilot, doing minimal studying and then going off to do aim training. It&rsquo;s good to have hobbies, but your hobbies shouldn&rsquo;t take up most of your time in a given day compared to the work that you have to do. It should be about equal, but the quality of both should be high.For me, it&rsquo;s skewed onto one side and that&rsquo;s the side of leisure, using excuses like my breakup and my illness to take over my head instead of truly reflecting on them and doing what I have to do.</p>
<p>I am not a child anymore. I am 23 years old. I can pay taxes, vote, legally drive (but can&rsquo;t), take out loans, I have a BA. But I don&rsquo;t work at the moment due to my health problems. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m not going to work forever as there are plenty of people with crohn&rsquo;s that are worse off and work much harder jobs than me. I am comfortable with my parents allowing me to stay at home for the time being, but I can&rsquo;t take this for granted forever yk? There has to come a point where I wake up and lock in again, and start building something of myself again.</p>
<p>YouTube isn&rsquo;t big income, but it&rsquo;s something, so I&rsquo;m dedicating more time towards video editing, script writing, recording, and getting other peoples&rsquo; opinions on what I&rsquo;ve written. I feel like the blog posts I write can kind of count of public venting while still putting up some boundaries between me and the reader. That&rsquo;s the point of it. I want to be raw, and I want others to see me as someone familiar instead of someone who is out of reach if that makes sense. I am a person just like everyone else. You don&rsquo;t have to overthink it. Just treat me like a human and I&rsquo;ll treat you like one too.</p>
<h1 id="streaming-again">Streaming again</h1>
<p>I know this may seem weird to some, but I am going back to daily streaming during the weekdays for the time being. I have to make some drastic changes in my life, and I think this one is the most drastic one I could make. I have to get done what has to get done without feeding into the temptations of blind consumption and whatnot. I know what works best for me, and I was doing what was best for me at the start of my relationship. That all went away over time though and I let myself go a lot. I don&rsquo;t know how to balance or manage my time and relationships. It&rsquo;s all really hard. Streaming again while my health is pretty good seems like a good choice for me. I know a lot of other people are coming back to streaming (like IPL and James) and for me, that makes it all the more motivating. I don&rsquo;t want to study alongside them though. I want to do my own thing while they do their own things.</p>
<h1 id="on-the-topic-of-videos">On the topic of videos&hellip;</h1>
<p>I recently recorded and lightly edited a video which I think was okay, but due to feedback from others I am going to re-write and re-record it. For those interested, it&rsquo;s a video covering my personal health and why taking care of yourself is the most important part of life. I haven&rsquo;t done that for most of my life, and I want it to be a warning/wakeup call to those who don&rsquo;t take their own health seriously, or are scared to talk to their parents about it.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s the post of the week. Thanks for reading :3</p>
