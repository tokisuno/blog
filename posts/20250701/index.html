<h1 id="introduction--what-is-this">Introduction :: What is this?</h1>
<p>Every Tuesday is now marked down in my calendar for a weekly blog post to keep the creative writing muscles flowing. I haven&rsquo;t been writing much in all honesty, so this is just one way I can keep at this. I am notoriously bad at keeping a rhythm as of recent, but I have to try and change that for the betterment of my life.</p>
<h1 id="whats-been-going-on">What&rsquo;s been going on?</h1>
<h2 id="computer-upgrades">Computer upgrades!!!</h2>
<p>Using my education funds, I was able to invest into a new CPU for my gaming/editing PC, and I moved the old parts over to a new study computer I built. I recently got a motherboard from some random on Discord because he said he broke off a capacitor under the GPU area, which left me with my old B350 Tomahawk and my Ryzen 5 3600. Performance on both computers has been a dream come true for me and I feel like I can actually get more done without having to worry about how much power I am drawing and how much my parents are going to be charged for our hydro.</p>
<p>Just to make things more simple, this is the new parts list for my two computers as of writing this.</p>
<ul>
<li>PC1 (Gaming, Editing)
<ul>
<li>Ryzen 7 5800XT</li>
<li>RTX 2060</li>
<li>32GB DDR4 (3200mhz)</li>
<li>1TB WD Blue M.2 SSD</li>
<li>Fedora 42 (AwesomeWM)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PC2 (Studying, Programming)
<ul>
<li>Ryzen 5 3600</li>
<li>GTX 780ti</li>
<li>16GB DDR4 (2666mhz)</li>
<li>500GB SATA SSD</li>
<li>Windows 11 (Existing is pain)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="finally-reinstalled-windows-11">FINALLY reinstalled Windows 11</h2>
<p>After talking about doing this for over a year, I have finally reinstalled Windows 11 and let me tell you, my performance is like 100x better than it was before. After installing my new CPU, I think I had some driver issues which was causing performance to be really inconsistent. On top of that, every time I shut down my PC I would be met with a BSOD reading <strong>CRITICAL_PROCESS_FAILURE</strong> which obviously CANNOT be good (LOL). I was getting around 114fps average in cs2 at times too because of the instability. After doing a full wipe, everything is great again!!! This does mean that the video I was working on is gone now, but I&rsquo;ll just work on something else that&rsquo;ll be better. Just you wait &gt;:)</p>
<p>(Sorry for making everyone wait. It&rsquo;s been unexpectedly really hard to bounce back, and I haven&rsquo;t been doing myself any favours.)</p>
<h2 id="i-love-aim-training">I love Aim Training</h2>
<p>I kind of rekindled and rediscovered my love for aiming. I used to play Kovaaks quite a bit when I played Apex during COVID but stopped once I started University. Now that I am out of Uni and started playing CS again, I&rsquo;ve been aim training again. I have my sensitivity set to 800dpi @ 0.85ingame for Source-based games (Apex, CS, etc&hellip;) which is about 61cm/360. I&rsquo;ll probably look into getting a bigger mousepad in the future and re-arranging my desk some more, but this is great for the time being. Speaking of desk&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="i-moved-my-setup-again">I moved my setup (again)</h2>
<p>My parents want to cut back on how much stuff I have in my rooms (which makes sense) so I moved both my study computer and my gaming computer onto the same desk. They both share my main monitor&rsquo;s input. The desk itself is a mess right now, and I have to look into getting a monitor arm for each of my monitors. My second monitor is locked to 60hz because my HDMI-DP cable doesn&rsquo;t support 144hz. The whole desk is just really scuffed right now. The lamp I use on top of my monitor is also really (really) broken, so I&rsquo;m going to throw that out too. There&rsquo;s just a lot of bloat that I have to get rid of/put into boxes.</p>
<h2 id="issues-with-my-right-arm">Issues with my right arm</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve talked about this openly (or at least it hasn&rsquo;t been documented on here) but I do have problems with the muscle in my right bicep. I used to jitter click really hard back in the day (Minecraft PVP) and I had really bad form. This led me to developing the muscle memory to vibrate whenever I tense my right arm. For those who know mice, I used to use an old Zowie FK1. Those have very heavy mouse switches (still my favourite sounding) which led to me tensing even HARDER. Whenever I lean my weight or lift anything super hard with my right arm, it starts shaking uncontrollably. I am gonna grab some athletic bands from my Dad and use those to work out smoothening my bicep movements. I have 20lb weights in my computer room that I don&rsquo;t really use because they would get in the way of my chair&rsquo;s arms, but I just removed them for ergonomics so those are back on the table ;) I just really want to be healthy and able-bodied so I am doing things to help improve that using things that are in my control.</p>
<h1 id="youtube-stuffz">YouTube Stuffz</h1>
<p>YouTube has been haunting me for some time. I just did a full reset of windows so the video I was working on previously is now gone. It&rsquo;s fine because it was pretty unfocused and all over the place, so I&rsquo;ll write out a more fleshed out version of it and record it either this week or next week. This is a very busy week for me, as I am going to see Babymetal in Toronto tomorrow, and then I am volunteering helping run a couple brackets at this GOML. This is the last iteration of GOML that will be done at the current venue, and I can&rsquo;t wait for it!!! I do have a script in the works for a &ldquo;Thank you GOML&rdquo; type video, and maybe that now I have the time and the upcoming clips it may be time to work with it. But I do have other things that I want to get to first.</p>
<p>Making things has been hard. I&rsquo;ve been more into music and doing Kovaaks if I am being completely honest. I haven&rsquo;t even been writing lyrics. I am just playing riffs and listening to music. The creative muscles have kinda been put on hold for some time, but they&rsquo;re itching to get out. I think something that drives me a lot is seeing others doing better than I am with their channels and knowing that I can do better. It&rsquo;s the competitor in me. That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ve gone through most of my YouTube career. I see something I think is objectively shit (in my eyes) that&rsquo;s doing pretty well, or something that I consider to have various flaws I find critical, and then I want to do better. Then I do better, and then go away again.</p>
<p>I look back at my old videos and I had more fun just talking about things into a camera without running with a script. I think that I am going to actually upload the rough draft that I sent to people earlier in the week just to kick-start something, and then have something done either this week or next week. This is all me thinking out-loud though.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now. Bye bye! See y&rsquo;all next Tuesday! :3</p>
