<h1 id="sinprezento">Sinprezento</h1>
<p>Saluton! Mi estas tokisuno. Mi ƒùojas rekonti vin. Mi estas Kanadano. Dum 2 semanjnoj, mi lernas Esperanton.</p>
<h1 id="going-back-to-my-roots">Going back to my roots</h1>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if many people realize this or have this in their mind when they think of me, but I am a Linguist. I mean, in reality we all are Linguists, but I studied Linguistics at University for just over 4 years of my life. I generally have a passion for learning, but I really (really) love learning about culture and language. I am planning on learning toki pona with my partner once she&rsquo;s finished with her term, but I have the itch to learn another conlang for the time being. So with that, I am going to study Esperanto daily for the next 11/12 days.</p>
<h1 id="why-esperanto">Why Esperanto?</h1>
<h2 id="1-ive-hated-it-needlessly-for-years">1. I&rsquo;ve hated it needlessly for years</h2>
<p>This means that I&rsquo;m going through my enemies-to-lovers arch with Esperanto LOL. In all honesty, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve given Esperanto as fair of a shot as I have with other things in life. I am kind of a hater. I am passionate about what I think is right and wrong, and what I find to be smart and stupid. I&rsquo;ve gone through this phase a lot with other things in my life. For example: I used to hate Melee Sheik, now I&rsquo;m a Sheik main. I used to think that I would never learn Japanese and that Kanji was stupid, now Kanji is my favourite part of learning Japanese. I used to think split-keyboards and trackball mice and Linux were all stupid, and that there was literally 0 reason to own a Mac computer. Now, I&rsquo;ve come around to all of them.</p>
<h2 id="2-evildea">2. Evildea</h2>
<p>I recently went to a BBNO$ concert in Toronto and ranted to a friend of mine about how stupid Esperanto is and was and how much I despise the attention it gets. Days after, I find this YouTuber named Evildea who makes videos on language YouTubers and his outlooks on language learning. I find his videos to be very interesting, and he&rsquo;s actually an Esperanto speaker! I think through seeing him talk about how much he loves Esperanto, the community, and the language, it&rsquo;s infectious for a language learner. He&rsquo;s also Australian so realistically he could say anything and I&rsquo;d agree with him. The accent&rsquo;s power is too strong&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>But yeah, through seeing his videos and him mentioning Esperanto I decided to look into it again. Upon my findings, I decided that it would actually be a really fun experiment! Keep in mind that I already speak English and Spanish, with some fluency in French, and I am currently studying Japanese every single day. I don&rsquo;t really study Spanish much anymore but still use it every day, so realistically the languages I use are English, Spanish, and Japanese. Now, I am adding esperanto into that mix, and I am interested in seeing how much I can learn and whether or not I&rsquo;d consider learning it in the farther future (when I have more time). I&rsquo;m thinking of uploading a video on it eventually so stay tuned for that!</p>
<p>I have promised a few videos in the past and those are still coming at some point. After using Duolingo for over a week straight I am already reminding myself to make that Duolingo video I was supposed to make some years back. I have to get into the habit of finishing things again.</p>
