<h1 id="theres-no-video-for-this-week-sorry">There&rsquo;s no video for this week (sorry!)</h1>
<p>Title. I kept it up for 3 weeks but with family coming, and my medication changing again, I really cannot the time or energy to film and edit anything. As of writing this, I&rsquo;ve already taken a 3-hour nap AFTER sleeping 7 hours last night. Fatigue is sometimes an unfortunate downside of my medication. The video for this week wasn&rsquo;t going to be anything special anyways. I was going to take a song from a small artist, and use it as background music for some sort of aim montage I&rsquo;ve been collecting clips for. But I don&rsquo;t have enough clips anyways LMAO.</p>
<p>Next week I&rsquo;ll release something more on-brand with what I&rsquo;m about. I&rsquo;ve been doin some cooking in the lab (the lab is org-mode)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all :p</p>
