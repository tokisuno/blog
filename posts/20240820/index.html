<p>It&rsquo;s been no surprise to anyone that I haven&rsquo;t been uploading anything lately, and a big portion of that is due to insecurity. I want to preface this article by emphasizing this isn&rsquo;t being posted for the sake of garnering sympathy. I find it therapeutic to write about my inner thoughts and post it online. This blog obviously isn&rsquo;t comprised of my deepest most inner thoughts &ndash; you guys aren&rsquo;t my therapist.</p>
<p>The whole point of me making this blog was so then I could write guides and rant about what I wanted to rant about and have people read it. I want to use this as another creative outlet. But I haven&rsquo;t been creative recently, and it&rsquo;s been bothering me. I used to edit videos for fun when I was a kid. I used to live by Sony Vegas and Photoshop and push through whatever I wanted to do just so then I could make something that looked okay. However, I&rsquo;ve always been an audio editor more than a video editor, but I&rsquo;ve been slacking on both while trying to just push out something. If you&rsquo;re making content or thinking about making content, make something that you&rsquo;d watch. Make a video that you would watch, make a thumbnail you&rsquo;d click on, make a title that would intrigue you.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get through a video and I think &ldquo;wow this is terrible&rdquo;, but since I sunk so much time into it I just upload it anyways just because I haven&rsquo;t done so in a while. I want to grow this channel, but I have no clear direction as to where I want to take it. I am a hobbyist, I love doing a lot of things and I have a lot of skills. Unfortunately I haven&rsquo;t been true to those skills due to me falling back into old habits. My health is still not the best, and living is a daily struggle. It&rsquo;s uncomfortable living as I am right now.</p>
<h1 id="content">Content</h1>
<p>I believe the biggest evil to be shame. Where there&rsquo;s guilt, there&rsquo;s shame. Where there&rsquo;s anger, there&rsquo;s shame. Shame shame shame. I feel a lot of shame. I feel ashamed for not doing as much as I&rsquo;ve wanted to, I feel ashamed for being as unwell as I am right now, I feel ashamed for not following through on my word. My dad works as a freelancer and I remember him telling me about a friend he had that was really flaky. He was all talk and wouldn&rsquo;t follow through on his word. I feel as if I am that right now, and I am not proud of it. Obvious I have good excuses, but that&rsquo;s all they are. Excuses. I don&rsquo;t want to sit around doing nothing and giving into degenerate temptations and addiction like I have been. I&rsquo;ve been doing a good job at not doing so too. But I feel bad when I leave this channel dormant to focus on my real life.</p>
<p>This is the most amount of subscribers and attention I&rsquo;ve gotten online before, and I don&rsquo;t really know how to deal with it, even if it&rsquo;s still small in numbers. There&rsquo;s a lot of eyes and attention and that&rsquo;s weird to me. I used to quit YouTube channels all the time when I wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;feeling it&rdquo;, or if &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like the direction I was going in.&rdquo; Keep in mind, I would make another channel with the same name most of the time, changing everything ever so slightly. I kept on restarting wanting to keep a smaller fanbase every time and once things got slightly bad in my head, I would run away. I chose to not run away with this account because I find it to be entertaining. I like my little community. But I have a problem of being too hard on myself which results in shame and guilt.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been feeling good about my content, and I haven&rsquo;t been feeling good about the identity I&rsquo;ve been creating on this channel. As I&rsquo;ve mentioned earlier, I have a lot of interests that I want to talk about and share with everyone but my video editing skills are far from good. Since starting The Odin Project, I haven&rsquo;t been as creative of as person as I normally am. I journal less, I think about content less, I write less. I give into the fatigue and don&rsquo;t bounce back for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start doing the free Davinci Resolve course that BlackMagic has online so I can become more familiar with it, so videos are hopefully going to be better by then. So until then, expect one or two videos before the summer ends. That&rsquo;s all for now.</p>
