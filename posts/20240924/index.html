<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>For those who follow my channel (idk how you would follow my channel and not be reading this), you would know that I have been going through TheOdinProject&rsquo;s JavaScript path in hopes of becoming either a freelancer or a web developer. I am taking a break from Linguistics for the time being and I think the way TOP structures itself is really useful. I&rsquo;d argue it&rsquo;s the best learning resource for getting into web development. But I had an issue, and that issue was JavaScript. I think JavaScript is a great language, but it isn&rsquo;t opinionated enough. Maybe JavaScript wasn&rsquo;t sticking in my head as much as I&rsquo;d have liked it to, but there was always something off putting. Honestly I&rsquo;d still boil it down to a skill issue since I am new, but I digress. This blog post is about why I am switching from the JavaScript path over to the Ruby one &gt;:)</p>
<h1 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h1>
<p>Because of university, I haven&rsquo;t had as much time to program as I&rsquo;d like. I am still a full time student for one more term, so I have to give it my best shot one more time before I graduate.</p>
<p>I was recently really sick with strep throat so I admittedly fell behind a bit, but my brain still wanted to be stimulated. I&rsquo;ve gotten into the habit of listening to audiobooks, but I had the itch to listen to programming talks. I follow ThePrimeagen and listen to whatever highlights he has that appeal to me, and one recently titled &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTa2d3OLXhg">DHH is right about everything</a>&rdquo; caught my eye. I tapped on the video, closed my eyes, and listened half way through before passing out. I was sick, exhausted, and sweating buckets, and it didn&rsquo;t even feel like much time had passed. I was so engaged in what DHH was saying and I absolutely love how opinionated he is. He briefly went over his timeline of how he learned to program and I resonated a lot with it. I have failed learning to program many times in the past, and I am back at it once again with a more mature head and a strong passion to learn. I now have a level of confidence and grit that I didn&rsquo;t have before, and it&rsquo;s made me a better learner.</p>
<p>Without getting too sidetracked, I will say that after listening, I was hooked. I wanted to learn more about Ruby, I wanted to learn Ruby, I wanted to hear people talk about Ruby, so on and so fourth. I do have an addictive personality and I always do deep dives into things that catch my interest, but this is something different. This is a life skill that I want to take forward with me for the rest of my life.</p>
<h1 id="philosophy-of-ruby-and-rails">Philosophy of Ruby and Rails</h1>
<p>The philosophy of Ruby is simple: to make the programmer happy. Yukihiro Matsumoto, the creator of Ruby, has famously said &ldquo;I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy,&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s just really cool to hear. Ruby has a syntax that makes you feel like you&rsquo;re almost writing in pseudo-code. It&rsquo;s very easy to understand from a first glance, and combined with Rails the possibilities are endless. Rails was created with productivity in mind, and it&rsquo;s very opinionated on what that means. This has made Ruby on Rails a popular choice even in today&rsquo;s age for spinning up working prototypes of applications and whatnot. I love that. I want to have that kind of creative freedom when writing code.</p>
<h1 id="interactions-with-ruby-developers">Interactions with Ruby developers</h1>
<p>Community matters a lot to me, and Ruby developers are just so fucking nice. I don&rsquo;t understand. I think it&rsquo;s due to Ruby on Rails being a more mature piece of software at this point, so you don&rsquo;t have people trying to reinvent a productive workflow and push it onto people every 6 months. It&rsquo;s calmed down a lot. The Ruby developers that I&rsquo;ve spoken to kind of reflect that. They&rsquo;re still using Ruby, and they&rsquo;re still using Rails, or they&rsquo;re even learning like I am. Interacting with Ruby developers really made me understand one thing: it doesn&rsquo;t matter what&rsquo;s new when all the old code bases still need maintenance.</p>
<h1 id="my-gamble">My gamble</h1>
<p>I am going to take a gamble when I say this. I am basing this only off of my own intuition and experiences. I have a belief that developers are going to reach a point where they&rsquo;re going to be done hopping and swapping and shifting around with JavaScript and Ruby is going to be a resurgence. There will be Ruby content creators, there will be more Ruby job opportunities at all levels, and it&rsquo;ll be the second coming of Ruby. This will happen after some sort of new major release.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I have spent so much time trying to convince myself that if I was programming, I had to make it harder for myself. Then I would language hop and fall into tutorial hell. TheOdinProject helped me out of that, and introduced me to the world of Ruby. Ruby&rsquo;s cool. Idk what else to say. That&rsquo;s all :p</p>
