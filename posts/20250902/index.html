<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome to this week of Toki Talks! This week, we&rsquo;re going to get a little deeper into life.</p>
<h1 id="becoming-the-person-i-want-to-be">Becoming the person I want to be</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken some time to think more about who I am, where I am, and how I want to get there. I&rsquo;ve come to the realization that as I am right now &ndash; although comfortable &ndash; isn&rsquo;t the same person I&rsquo;d want to be in even a year, or two years at that. I don&rsquo;t know if many of you have come to this realization, but it&rsquo;s like experiencing another ego death where I feel like everything is becoming clearer and my life is being put back into perspective for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to first point out that I do have self compassion towards myself, but it does go too far. There comes a point of having too much self compassion where you become negligent of life as a whole, and I&rsquo;ve definitely reached that stage once again. I got a notification this week for my screentime, and it isn&rsquo;t pretty. I logged 7.5 hours of iPhone screentime a day. I realized at the moment I walk around with my phone in my hand like it&rsquo;s a part of me. I can&rsquo;t let go of it. I am constantly using it for some sort of stimulation. There&rsquo;s no justification for using it as much as I have been. It&rsquo;s just been pure copium. I am 23 years old, living with my parents with little to no incoming from freelancing/YouTube, and spend a good portion of the day either on my phone, on the toilet, or both. This isn&rsquo;t how I want to live. It&rsquo;s a shitty (pun intended) reality. It&rsquo;s hard for me to separate me acknowledging that this isn&rsquo;t an ideal life and getting lost in &ldquo;shit life syndrome.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think I have a terrible life overall. I have a great to be completely honest. I am grateful to have the opportunities that I have. It&rsquo;s just really upsetting feeling like I&rsquo;m being left behind in life. Here I am, just writing to a tiny blog that almost no one reads, on a stream that almost no one watches, while other friends of mine are either going back to school, or are working, or have finished their masters.</p>
<h1 id="coping-with-illness">Coping with illness</h1>
<p>More than anything, it&rsquo;s been hard coping with illness. I&rsquo;ve been distracting myself with technology because I feel scared and lost by this reality. I&rsquo;ve been in a very dark place the past week and I haven&rsquo;t been coping with the thoughts well. That&rsquo;s apparent by my phone usage. I&rsquo;m not straight-up giving up on everything. I still stream for a short period of time a day before the body discomfort and fatigue kick into high gear. I think that it&rsquo;s really easy to say &ldquo;oh you aren&rsquo;t your illness! You are more than that!&rdquo; without being in that position. I lived 22 years without being considered legally <em>disabled</em>. Sure it&rsquo;s just a label and I am more than that. Hell, I am externally very healthy and able-bodied. But I am not. You just can&rsquo;t see it. It&rsquo;s hard not to label myself as something when it&rsquo;s all so new and I am trying to navigate through it. I am trying to understand it. I already have OCD, and the complications of having Crohn&rsquo;s and the other issues I&rsquo;m having weight a lot on my conscious. So why not just say &ldquo;fuck it&rdquo; and spend a lot of time scrolling reddit or instagram? It&rsquo;s bad but it&rsquo;s been my reality for the past few months (especially since my breakup).</p>
<h1 id="relationships">Relationships</h1>
<p>I have a hard time coping and maintaining healthy relationships. I&rsquo;ve lived so long just speaking what&rsquo;s going on in my life and oversharing. It was a contentious part of my past relationship. It&rsquo;s also why I&rsquo;ve had lots of friends either ghost me, drop me, or give up on me. I just speak. I am not a healthy person and I&rsquo;ve never been one. I was extremely depressed in highschool, was switching mind-altering medications throughout most of university, and then came out getting a chronic illness from some freak accident. Although I am aware everyone in life has their own issues and I acknowledge it, I genuinely think I&rsquo;ve been super unlucky. Maybe this comes from trying to meet people and grow relationships, failing, and then starting again. I put myself in a position for failure to be possible. But that&rsquo;s the reality of my life, and talking about it can feel like a weight on other peoples&rsquo; shoulders. They might feel like they want to help or they feel overwhelmed knowing they can&rsquo;t do anything about it, and it becomes a weight on their conscious. It&rsquo;s unfair for them that I am the way I am, and that I don&rsquo;t fully disclose or create an environment more &ldquo;normal?&rdquo; or like, not heavy? I don&rsquo;t know the wording for it.</p>
<p>I feel like right now I am both the most mentally healthy that I&rsquo;ve ever been, but still far from being healthy, and that affects my relationships. I say relationships in all forms of the word.</p>
<h1 id="life">Life</h1>
<p>Life is about failing and picking yourself up again, and it&rsquo;s the most difficult part of the human experience. Picking yourself back up and going back at it is extremely difficult, but it&rsquo;s what the most successful and inspiring people have done. It&rsquo;s this stubbornness and determination that I find very admirable. I feel like I get there, and then I fall out of it because of some form of intense sadness or depression that&rsquo;s come with my health issues. But here I am once again, making videos pretty regularly while trying to deal with the present and get over the past. If you&rsquo;re reading this and you&rsquo;re from my personal life, thank you for sticking around. If you aren&rsquo;t a part of my life anymore, I wish you the best and I hope you&rsquo;re doing well. I&rsquo;ve had a lot weighing on my mind and I haven&rsquo;t had the best coping methods to help me through this. I want to be a better friend and a better person. This post isn&rsquo;t the kickstart to this and there won&rsquo;t be immediate change, but this is a sign that change is to come.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for this week. Thanks for reading! Hope this wasn&rsquo;t too upsetting of a read LMAO.</p>
