<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>After reading &ldquo;The Inner Game of Tennis&rdquo; and &ldquo;Atomic Habits&rdquo; for the first time, I started trusting myself more than ever before. The results came with it too, as I was able to perform well and improve in anything I put my mind to at a rate I had never experienced before. Then, life hit and slowly but surely to mask my true feelings, I started falling back into old habits. These old habits mainly involve self-disparaging comments which at first, were just jokes! I knew who I was better than anyone else, so me saying this things like how I used to should be fine, right? <em><strong>Right?</strong></em></p>
<p>As it turns out, no. I had proven before that before I was making such jokes as a form of deflection and trying to save myself from bullying. I made the jokes out of my own insecurity because deep inside it&rsquo;s how I really felt, and it manifested into how I saw myself. From there, my habits got worse, looser, flakier, and now they barely exist. But what better time than now to get back into it!?</p>
<p>This post is mainly for myself and to leave a marker of where I started, and I&rsquo;ll probably report back again by the end of the year. I want to set 3 habits that I will do consistently every day until the end of the year.</p>
<h1 id="habits">Habits!</h1>
<h2 id="1-read-2-hours-a-day">1. Read 2 hours a day</h2>
<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>This is a bit one since I have fallen really behind my reading goal for the end of the year, and I don&rsquo;t want to change it. I want to read 50 novels by the end of the year, short or long. It&rsquo;s a very attainable goal and I know I can reach it. I just haven&rsquo;t been reading as much as I used to.</p>
<h3 id="how-ill-get-there">How I&rsquo;ll get there</h3>
<p>I recently got myself an Amazon Fire stick for my TV in my bedroom. I got back into the bad habit of going on YouTube for long periods of time (YouTube addiction is real) and it&rsquo;s been causing me to spend more time that I&rsquo;d like to admit either on the couch, on the toilet, and on my phone in general. This is to separate my association with YouTube and my phone so I can have a healthier relationship with it.</p>
<p>I have a rocking chair in my bedroom that I haven&rsquo;t been using, and I think it&rsquo;s time I take that bad-boy for a spin &gt;:) (I literally bought it so I could read and I&rsquo;ve only read a total of like 30 minutes on it LMFAO)</p>
<h2 id="2-5-minute-run-every-morning">2. 5 minute run every morning</h2>
<h3 id="goal-1">Goal</h3>
<p>My walking cardio is honestly peak. I love walking and although I haven&rsquo;t been doing it as much due to health reasons, walking is one of my favourite pastimes. However, I&rsquo;ve been wanting to get into running for some years now, but never found myself to do it. Until the end of the year for every morning, I am going to go on at least a 5 minute run around my area.</p>
<h3 id="how-ill-get-there-1">How I&rsquo;ll get there.</h3>
<p>I normally wake up early but don&rsquo;t do anything demanding to get my heart racing. Since I won&rsquo;t be doom-scrolling on YouTube every morning anymore, this leaves me a LOT more time in the morning to exist and be a normal functioning human being. I&rsquo;ll just take my tired ass outside with music, run around for a bit, and then go back inside to shower. Awesome!</p>
<h2 id="3-device-usage-schedule">3. Device usage schedule</h2>
<h3 id="goal-2">Goal</h3>
<p>Now this is a big one that I have been breaking for some time now. I used to have some semblance of self-control/boundary-setting for when I go to sleep, but overtime that&rsquo;s slowly dissolved. I still wake up pretty early every single morning, but my sleep has been suffering due to my bad habits and relationship with my phone. My eyes and brain need a break, so after 9:30 (21:30) I will get off my devices.</p>
<p>I also have trouble in the morning with using my phone. My boundary with it used to be better, but lately I&rsquo;ve found myself checking my messages and socials more frequently. I&rsquo;ve been trying to find &ldquo;the video to listen to&rdquo; while in the shower (even though I can never really hear what they&rsquo;re saying anyways) and it&rsquo;s been costing me a LOT of time that could be use actually showering and whatnot. My goal with my phone usage is to only touch it after I&rsquo;ve done what I want to do in the morning. It&rsquo;s addictive and distracting, and it&rsquo;s better to distance myself to sever the toxic relationship I have with it to improve my quality-of-life!</p>
<h3 id="how-ill-get-there-2">How I&rsquo;ll get there</h3>
<p>I will let people in my life know to keep my accountable for this. I will also set timers and whatnot in order to ensure I stay on top of this. The reason why it specifies <em>mobile devices</em> is because sometimes I watch a YouTube video before bed with my Dad. I have a pretty good relationship with that so I don&rsquo;t find it to be something I&rsquo;d want to exploit or anything. I also don&rsquo;t really watch TV in my room anyways, and the problem stems with my relationship with my mobile devices. After 9:30, it&rsquo;s e-reader only to go to sleep to and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>When I go to bed, I will keep my phone in a drawer so it&rsquo;s out of sight, and I&rsquo;ll ignore it. If I have a system, I am pretty good at following it. I just haven&rsquo;t had a system in place for a while so I&rsquo;ve been trying to rely on &ldquo;raw willpower&rdquo; which is never a good idea.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I have outlined 3 habits I want to set and follow every day for the rest of the year. This will all be starting tomorrow, and will hopefully build towards me having a better tomorrow. Thanks for reading :3</p>
