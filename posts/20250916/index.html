<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a hard pill for me to swallow for some time now, but I think I have finally came to the realiziation that I don&rsquo;t have as much time to game as I&rsquo;d like to think I do. I also place way too much value on gaming achievements compared to other parts of my real life.</p>
<h1 id="real-life-goals-vs-gaming-goals">Real life goals vs Gaming goals</h1>
<p>I made goals at the beginning of the year for myself, and looking back on them a lot of them had to do with gaming and other things that didn&rsquo;t relate to my own personal growth. I do see gaming as some form of personal growth because I see competitive gaming as a form of personal expression. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about myself and how I deal with life through the lens of competitive gaming. But I have other things in my life that need more attention, like how I am going to live for the rest of my life and how I am going to make money doing things online. I sort of clock out at a certain point of the day (also depends heavily on how my health has been that day) and then spend the rest of the time gaming as a way of escapism. Although I have set real life goals for myself, I am scared of taking the next step forward in fear of rejection and thinking that what I do will never be good enough, and that I&rsquo;ve wasted all my time and effort. I am familiar and comfortable with competitive gaming, so it&rsquo;s easy to just hop over to. It&rsquo;s the same with any other type of addiction or unhealthy relationship. We always go back to what&rsquo;s familiar. In this case, it&rsquo;s playing CS2.</p>
<h2 id="i-have-a-lot-of-time-to-myself-which-means-i-have-a-lot-of-time-to-escape-reality">I have a lot of time to myself which means I have a lot of time to escape reality.</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if people realize this, but it takes a lot to post yourself online. It took a lot to post myself online. I never really wanted to be a YouTuber with a face for most of my life. I was always faceless and used some sort of avatar. I thought it would be cool to do while in university however so then people could see a face they could relate to. They could see that I&rsquo;m a person just like them. I deal with a lot of self-doubt and I can just sort of ignore that with gaming. It&rsquo;s easier to go after gaming than it is something like programming or content creation. I mainly want to do content creation, but the vulnerability is hard at times, especially on as large of a scale as I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<h1 id="pride">Pride</h1>
<p>There&rsquo;s too much pride in myself and in what I do. I always think that I can do things my way because &ldquo;my way is the best way and the only correct one&rdquo; when in all actuality I couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. That&rsquo;s the stubbornness bleeding in. It takes a long time for me to admit things to myself. I took some time to write down on paper what really matters to me in the present and how I can work on that, dividing everything into their own quadrants and spaces for focus. Visualization helps me a lot, and it&rsquo;s what this week&rsquo;s video is mostly about (stay tuned :p).</p>
<h1 id="content-creation">Content creation</h1>
<p>I have all the time in the world, and content creation is right there. Yet, I don&rsquo;t do it nearly as often as I should or as I&rsquo;d like to. I look at people like Sylvan Franklin, and he uploads pretty regularly. It&rsquo;s very admirable. I see other friends of mine doing regular study streams that run for long hours, and that consistency is great. I think I&rsquo;ve underestimated how much creativity I have and how much I really want to talk about. I&rsquo;ve started reading again and writing to myself, and it&rsquo;s unlocked something. Now almost every day I have either written down a new video idea, or I&rsquo;ve edited other scripts I want to upload.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for this week. Thanks for reading :3</p>
