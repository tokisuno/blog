<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome back to another (late) weekly addition of Toki Talks!</p>
<h1 id="uneventful-week-honestly">Uneventful week honestly</h1>
<p>This is going to be more of a throw-away post as I don&rsquo;t really have anything to really write about. I&rsquo;ve spent a good portion of this week either gaming, editing, or resting. Yesterday especially was a pretty bad day for me so I spent a good portion just laying down in bed with fatigue and exhaustion. My mood also varies greatly and that&rsquo;s due to the uncertainty of the future. I haven&rsquo;t really programmed much lately and I feel like I&rsquo;m falling behind on a lot of stuff. I also think that my newest video could have been done better but that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. It just sorta sucks seeing everyone live their lives, and I&rsquo;m just stuck with uncertainties with my health, unable to work.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Sorry for the doomer kind of post. That&rsquo;s all for this week. For those wondering where the &ldquo;Life is like a bus&rdquo; post, that&rsquo;s to come later, as I want to make more changes and expand on it further. Thanks for reading :p</p>
