<p>A bit over a year ago I went rock climbing for the first time, and suffered a pretty annoying concussion. I say it was annoying because I felt pretty find afterwards aside from the brain swelling sending mixed signals to different parts of my body. But I was okay-ish. I have diagnosed OCD and part of my OCD is an increased awareness of my bowels. I am hyper-aware of what goes on down there and it has led to lots of inconveniences in my life. I did go through a stint of IBS at one point a few years ago due to my diet, but that&rsquo;s been long gone.</p>
<p>Some complications came about through my OCD being affected by what this concussion was telling me, which led be going to the hospital multiple times in 2023 and 2024. I&rsquo;d put myself through the emergency room because of the amount of pain and discomfort I&rsquo;d be in. I love my parents, but I didn&rsquo;t want to inconvenience them. I don&rsquo;t want to be a burden on them. So for the early stages of me figuring this all out, I didn&rsquo;t really tell them what was going on. I didn&rsquo;t really go in-depth. I thought it would all be over soon. Fast forward a year and that couldn&rsquo;t be farther from the case.</p>
<p>I kept going to the doctor, I saw a colorectal surgeon, a GI specialist, I&rsquo;ve had a colonoscopy and an MRI with more to come in the future, and finally I got a diagnosis. Crohn&rsquo;s disease. It&rsquo;s strange being told you have a life-long illness. Honestly, surgeon told me that there&rsquo;s a slim chance that I have Crohn&rsquo;s. I had some of the signs, but there were some major ones that I wasn&rsquo;t hitting which he found weird. Then over a zoom call with a GI specialist, I was told that I have Crohn&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>For the past year and some change, I have been an insufferable person. I have been more anal (pun intended) and I haven&rsquo;t been garnering the audience I wanted in the beginning. I was miserable, some days unable to stream for more than 3 hours due to how uncomfortable I was in my own skin. I felt like laying down and crying because I didn&rsquo;t know what the fuck was wrong with me. <em>My body shouldn&rsquo;t be this way. Why do I keep getting sick? Why does it feel like my body is fighting itself?</em> Well funny story; it was.</p>
<p>Crohn&rsquo;s disease is an autoimmune disease. My stomach, for whatever reason, decides that it&rsquo;s its job to solve my problems. It attacks both the good and bad bacteria in my stomach which leads to me having a weaker stomach. It attacks both good and bad cells which means I am more at risk at being sick. In its confusion, the side effects start, and the discomfort sets in. This is how I have been living for the past year. It&rsquo;s dehumanizing knowing that your body is fighting against you. It&rsquo;s scary knowing that there&rsquo;s nothing you can immediately do to cure it. It&rsquo;s scary not being in control. That&rsquo;s just something I have to get over.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t to attack sympathy. This is a brief retelling (which lots of information left out) about how I got here, and my reasoning for my being inactive. If you&rsquo;re reading this, you&rsquo;re pretty cool. Thank you.</p>
