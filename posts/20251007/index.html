<h1 id="oops">Oops</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how right after I make my last blog post, I have a massive relapse and wasted a TON of time on gaming. I think I found a new reason to quit however, and it has to do with where I live</p>
<h2 id="i-hate-southern-ontario">I Hate Southern Ontario</h2>
<p>Southern Ontario is a funny place in Canada. We are densely populated, have an insanely high cost of living, an immigration problem, degree mills, the most populated city in the country, and humidity that makes summertime feel like we&rsquo;re living in Hong Kong. When I say it&rsquo;s bad, it&rsquo;s bad. We can have our -10/-20 degree (CELSIUS) winters with extreme cold warnings, WHILE also having 40 degree summers after the humidity kicks in. We don&rsquo;t have the most extreme cold, but somehow we are suffocated by the heat for 3 months of the year.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-has-to-do-with-gaming">What this has to do with gaming&hellip;</h2>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t live in a humid country, let me educate you on something. The humidity can have some unintended effects on things you don&rsquo;t really think about. Your body still depends a lot on this, but I (for example) cannot use glossy mice to save my life. My hands sweat, and I lose my grip easily on them. I need a matte coating or grip tape, or else I won&rsquo;t be able to even hold a mouse properly. Okay, so that&rsquo;s fine if I am programming. That&rsquo;s an easy fix.</p>
<p>A not so easy fix is the mousepad. To my own fault, I have pretty cheap mousepads. The two mousepads I switch between are both aliexpress &ldquo;control&rdquo; mousepads, and when the humidity isn&rsquo;t terrible, they&rsquo;re pretty alright. Just decent. It&rsquo;s what I like when I play CS. But when the humidity is bad, oh god&hellip;</p>
<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re playing a game and suddenly mouse acceleration turns on, and you cannot turn it off. That&rsquo;s how it feels. Different parts of the pad feel faster than others, sometimes it feels like I&rsquo;m pushing my mouse over a small hump (even if it&rsquo;s completely flat), other times it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m transitioning from playing on a speed pad to playing on the muddiest cloth pad on earth. This makes aiming near impossible to get consistent for me, and I hate it with a passion.</p>
<h2 id="solutions-to-this">Solutions to this</h2>
<p>There are two solutions for this.</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy a new mousepad that can mitigate these side-effects of humidity</li>
<li>Buy a dehumidifier</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem with these two solutions is that they require money, money that I do not have.</p>
<h1 id="applying-for-jobs">Applying for jobs</h1>
<p>I finally bit the bullet and decided to apply to jobs in my area so I can make money instead of sitting at home all day. I know that it&rsquo;s going to be pretty shitty and uncomfortable, but at this point I need to start building some sort of savings. YouTube doesn&rsquo;t pay me basically at all because I don&rsquo;t get that many views. I don&rsquo;t stream anymore, but that also didn&rsquo;t really pay anything. I&rsquo;ve also started thinking (THINKING) about streaming some gaming on twitch again, like something more casual like aim-training or Balatro runs. This would incentivise some sort of subscriptions and/or donations, but I also dislike Twitch as a platform and their ad systems. Oh well, we&rsquo;ll see what happens in the future :')</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Sorry for taking a long break without saying anything. Thanks for reading :)</p>
