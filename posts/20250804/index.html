<h1 id="welcome-back">Welcome back!</h1>
<p>Another week, another Toki Talks! This past weekend, I did a lot of reflection on how I have been managing my time, and to say the least I didn&rsquo;t like what I saw in myself.</p>
<h1 id="commitment-to-content-creation--programming">Commitment to content creation + programming</h1>
<p>I realized this past weekend that on average, I was only really taking 20 hours per work-week (Monday → Friday) to study programming. This doesn&rsquo;t really add up considering that I don&rsquo;t have a job and spend all day at time. On top of that. My steam records say that I spend approximately 30 hours a week gaming. Therefore, I am spending more time gaming than programming. Why am I spending more time gaming, something that isn&rsquo;t going to bring more value into my life, instead of practicing and perfecting things that will add value?</p>
<p>I have family visiting for some time next week, so I won&rsquo;t be available to do our normally scheduled programming (sorry), but afterwards I do plan on streaming Monday → Saturday so I can get my studying hours up! This also does mean that I have to be more rigorous with how I both plan and edit videos for the week :p That&rsquo;s a net positive for you guys though!</p>
<h1 id="not-chasing-creative-endeavours">Not chasing creative endeavours</h1>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been writing or thinking of ideas to make videos on. I haven&rsquo;t been reading for the past 3-4 months. I haven&rsquo;t been making music. I&rsquo;ve either been programming, or spending a copious amount of time aim-training. I&rsquo;ve been living on autopilot if I&rsquo;m being honest, filling the time that I spend resting in my day with mindless consumption of content.</p>
<p>I have creative goals that I want to accomplish by the time I turn 25.</p>
<ul>
<li>Release a fully original EP</li>
<li>Have a fiction book released</li>
<li>Have a compilation of short stories/essays published</li>
</ul>
<p>I also have goals that aren&rsquo;t strictly creative</p>
<ul>
<li>Have consistent passive income through YouTube/online endeavours</li>
<li>Be able to make money through computer programming</li>
<li>Pass the JLPT N3 test</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="possible">Possible.</h1>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that these goals are super lofty/out-there for me. I think they are very doable given the time constraints. It&rsquo;s just that I have been clouding my brain with slop and coping through consuming more slop, which has in turn made my quality of life lower than I&rsquo;d want it to be. The problem I have with gaming isn&rsquo;t the gaming itself. It&rsquo;s how I am when I game. I get shorter, I am very competitive, and I don&rsquo;t know when to quit. It&rsquo;s a proper addiction when I get into the flow of it. I am way less productive right now than I was when I didn&rsquo;t play CS for 4-6 years. Like, it&rsquo;s noticeable. I am not being lazy due to depression. I am being lazy because I am latching onto dopamine heavy high APM activities because they make me feel productive.</p>
<p>I am a very competitive person. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the outlet is. I want to get better. If I win, then I win and I will obviously enjoy it. But if I don&rsquo;t win, I want to learn why I didn&rsquo;t win, how the other person was doing better, and observe what I was doing wrong. At the end of the day, I am a grinder. Through and through. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a problem either. I just have to focus that energy elsewhere in my life that will help me long term and bring me more value.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s the end of this week&rsquo;s Toki Talk! See y&rsquo;all next week o7</p>
