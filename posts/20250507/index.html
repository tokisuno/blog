<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The title doesn&rsquo;t lie. I am going back to learning JavaScript. I&rsquo;ve spent a long time going through the Ruby path trying to learn Ruby, and I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that I really don&rsquo;t care that much at the moment about Rails.</p>
<h1 id="enjoyment-programming">Enjoyment programming</h1>
<p>I honestly haven&rsquo;t enjoyed the Ruby path that much. During TOP foundations and further into the JS path, I really enjoyed making things and seeing the things that I made. It&rsquo;s because we start by learning HTML/CSS/JS and then get to choose what we want to do from there. That&rsquo;s fine and all, but I didn&rsquo;t get nearly as much satisfaction or enjoyment doing the projects in the Ruby path as I was when doing the JavaScript path. There are a lot of things that I do really like about Ruby, but I feel like I really just need JavaScript&rsquo;s ecosystem for the foreseeable future. I was in a relationship for almost a year, and during that time I wanted to have some sort of stability in my very chaotic shitshow of a life, so I thought that I could control that by using a language that is seemingly &ldquo;meant for programmer happiness&rdquo; and stability. I wanted to have some sort of job where I could work from anywhere just maintaining older code and living like a retired old person. But now that the relationship has ended and I am getting further back into programming, I realized that I haven&rsquo;t been enjoying programming in Ruby as much as I thought I was.</p>
<h1 id="do-i-hate-ruby">Do I hate Ruby?</h1>
<p>No. That&rsquo;s a dumb question. Ruby is an amazing language and Rails is an amazing framework. I never got as far as using Rails, but from what I&rsquo;ve heard it&rsquo;s really good. The Ruby language is also a very beautiful language and I do not regret learning it to the extent that I did. I just find that the simple things that I do with Ruby don&rsquo;t really need to be done with Ruby at all.</p>
<h1 id="getting-back-into-javascript">Getting back into JavaScript</h1>
<p>I have a few tasks in my org agenda that are to get me back to familiarity with JavaScript which are going to be very useful. I&rsquo;m basically just working on other projects and I&rsquo;m going to go back through the JavaScript section of TOP in order to get back up to speed/familiarity/comfort with the language and workflow. So yeah, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
