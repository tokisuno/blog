<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Something sparked in my brain. Although I don&rsquo;t make basically any content on YouTube at the moment, I have a lot of scripts that I have lying around that after a few minor tweaks, will be good to be recorded. With that being said, I&rsquo;ve been saying that for almost a year now and last year I really didn&rsquo;t pump out as much as I wanted to. So to combat that, I will continue not uploading that much and make weekly blog posts! LOL</p>
<h1 id="identity-struggle">Identity struggle</h1>
<p>There&rsquo;s this struggle between me and the identity of &ldquo;tokisuno&rdquo; online that I&rsquo;ve been struggling to keep in check. There are videos that I want to push out that I just want to push out, and those that I know will do well but I don&rsquo;t want to become a shill. I have diagnosed OCD, and upon further research there&rsquo;s this sub-strain/type of OCD called OCPD (Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder) which honestly speaks to me. Knowing what it is I am fighting against is one part of the battle, but the rest of it is harder.</p>
<p>Maybe this will speak to some of you, but it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s this brain worm that lives in my brain (straight blanchin&rsquo;) that goes into fight or flight whenever someone says anything. I think it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve spent so much time online, and didn&rsquo;t have a super health friend group for a good portion of my formative years (oops). This has led to me developing unhealthy relationships with others because of what a group of kids I hung out with when I was younger told me was &ldquo;right.&rdquo; It internalized. A lot of my sexuality-based self hate comes from them. If I don&rsquo;t do X then I am &ldquo;gay&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s a bad thing apparently, so I don&rsquo;t want to be that. <em>I can&rsquo;t talk or stand a certain way because that&rsquo;s girly and you don&rsquo;t want to be labelled a queer! Then you&rsquo;re a liability!!!</em> Love it! /s</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made me scared to even put the bisexual flag in my videos since I was afraid of being found online and being rejected for who I am. This fear of what others think of me combined with this obsession of being authentically and truthfully myself has been this war waging inside my brain. Maybe others can relate?</p>
<h1 id="being-wrong">Being wrong</h1>
<p>When you see people getting called out every 8 seconds for being &ldquo;cringe&rdquo; or &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; online in a massive way, it puts you on edge. I haven&rsquo;t been uploading because honestly, I have a fear of being wrong. I am afraid of getting something wrong in a video and having my entire channel and life being ruined by it. I am afraid that if I don&rsquo;t make my sentences as un-ambiguous as possible that I will be clipped out of context and become a laughing stock. I&rsquo;ve seen it happen before, and it terrifies me how much power people have on the internet. It&rsquo;s a completely different world from the real world, one that I&rsquo;ve spent majority of my life on.</p>
