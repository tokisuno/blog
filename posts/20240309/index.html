<p>So&hellip; I did say that I was going to do weekly posts, and I am back to say that I&rsquo;m going back to doing those. When I initially said that, I was going through a lot of personal stuff and didn&rsquo;t want to figure out how my git repos actually worked, so I mental boomed and didn&rsquo;t post to here for a hot minute. It turns out all I had to do was switch branches in my public repo, and then push new commits, and now everything is fine.</p>
<p>Oopsies. LMFAO.</p>
<p>But yeah, I want to make writing more of a habit instead of whatever the hell I am doing right now. I think it&rsquo;s nice for those who are somewhat interested in my content and university life to see regular updates from someone literally living that life right now.</p>
<p>For those of you concerned about me falling behind in my reading goals, I am here to say that I am still reading, but it&rsquo;s along with course readings that aren&rsquo;t books. In terms of books related to learning, I am reading two at the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Programming-Modern-Approach-K-King/dp/0393979504">C Programming: A Modern Approach (2nd ed.)</a>
<ul>
<li>I swear every single year, I have the random urge to start learning programming again. The issue is I never really know what to program, or what goals I even have with programming. Hell, I don&rsquo;t have goals for programming. So with that in mind, I decided to dive head-first into learning C properly for the first time. I learned some C a year ago during the summer when I was doing CS50 (never completed). I remember having a lot of fun with it. It&rsquo;s honestly a fun language to tinker and learn around with. From what I saw on reddit, this book seemed to be what people recommend, and I can see why.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Core-Syntax-Minimalist-David-Adger/dp/0199243700">Core Syntax: A Minimalist Approach</a>
<ul>
<li>I am trying to be a Linguist, specifically in the field of Theoretical Syntax (Morphosyntax also seems really cool). The issue is, I don&rsquo;t really have much experience with Syntax anymore. I took the course for it in my second year, and took an advanced course last year. Lots of time has passed since then, and I&rsquo;ve honestly not been the best linguist. So I want to try and fix that by once again, reading over the basics and more to reinforce my knowledge. I want to make sure I really know what I am talking about, and that I can back up my knowledge with sufficient readings. I want to be articulate. I don&rsquo;t think this is necessarily THE book to end all books, but it&rsquo;s better to start somewhere than nowhere at all. My professor had also recommended it at one point so why not give it a full read-through to see what it&rsquo;s all about. It beats reading Chomsky! ;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a deep-rooted insecurity with my major, one that I may talk about some other day, where I doubt myself and my knowledge a lot. The reason for it is not being up-to-date or doing research practicums. I wanted to do everything on my own behind closed doors, without any help. I also fear not being able to have a job in the future with my work (which
doesn&rsquo;t exist yet), so I always fall back into my programming. So what I am doing is compromising with my inner self: I will learn C but for every hour I study C, I have to read Core Syntax and take notes on what I read. That way, I have to continue interacting with Syntax.</p>
<p>But yeah. That&rsquo;s the mini update. See y&rsquo;all next week!</p>
