<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I have a big fear of burning out, and I do mean a <em>big fear</em> of burning out. If you have never experienced burnout before, I salute you for making it this far in life. According to <a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/burnout-symptoms-signs">WebMD</a>, symptoms of burnout include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Feelings of self-doubt</li>
<li>Losing a sense of purpose</li>
<li>Feeling increasingly more cynical, dissatisfied, and incapable.</li>
<li>Bodily fatigue</li>
<li>Lowered immune system (get sick more often)</li>
<li>Body aches and recurring headaches</li>
<li>Loss of appetite</li>
<li>Insomnia</li>
</ol>
<p>These are all symptoms that I know all too well, and it worries me when I plan a day to myself program only to feel terrible and unaccomplished after. I normally fight myself out of the thought trap because, quite frankly, relaxation is vital to ensuring a healthy lifestyle. But with all of that being said, this fear I&rsquo;ve had has caused me to be not as productive as I like and I thought it would interesting to talk about it here for those who feel alone in their own struggles.</p>
<h1 id="my-experience-with-burnout">My experience with burnout</h1>
<h2 id="insecurity">Insecurity</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier I have experienced burnout many time throughout my life, but I think one of my lowest points was in Grade 12 when I was choosing University majors. For those of you were aren&rsquo;t aware, I was originally going to go to Laurier for a B.A. in Computer Science + Spanish, but I decided against it due to burnout. My parents were really supportive of me wanting to go into programming, but I wasn&rsquo;t super secure with my choice yet. I was (and still am) a very insecure person who would try to please my parents without actually acting on my actions so I could see the momentary hope and happiness in them before I inevitably let them down. So whenever my parents would ask what I wanted to do in the future, I would tell them I wanted to get into Web Development, specifically Web Design since I think it&rsquo;s really fun and interesting. But I wouldn&rsquo;t ever say exactly that. It would always be in some weird round-about way that they couldn&rsquo;t understand because I would very anxious. I wanted to go into Web Development, but would often tell my parents that I was also interested in the backend (which wasn&rsquo;t entirely wrong, I just had no experience with it). I wouldn&rsquo;t do a good job of explaining it because I was scared of what they might think of me. I was scared they wouldn&rsquo;t support me. I was scared of making the wrong choice. Because of that, I was doing a very <strong>very</strong> bad job of selling them what it is that I like doing. This lack of confidence and overall mental fog made me question myself constantly. Since both of my parents have absolutely no clue what Web Development is but are still super cool and supportive parents, they continued to haphazardly support me, constantly pushing me into a direction that I didn&rsquo;t want to go into because they didn&rsquo;t know better. Since AI was becoming the hot new thing, they would talk to me about AI and how I should get a head start right now, and how since robots are going to take over jobs one day that I should really invest my time into doing robotics at school. None of that seemed appealing to me, and I kept explaining that wasn&rsquo;t what I wanted to do.</p>
