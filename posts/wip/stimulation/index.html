<p>As someone who has ADHD, finding stimulation is a struggle. I find myself having urges I wish I didn&rsquo;t had to gain some sort of happiness inside me, mainly temporary. The internet ruined my dopamine receptors and it&rsquo;s something I am actively trying to fix. I find myself latching onto anything that brings me joy for the short amount of time that it does. Let&rsquo;s call this &ldquo;being in my own world&rdquo;. When I am in this &ldquo;world&rdquo; of mine, for however long it may be, I find myself disconnected from reality trying to get into some sort of groove or zone. Anyone that tries to break me out of it will see a not very pleasant side of me. Finding anything to stimulate my brain is difficult. When I do find it, I don&rsquo;t want to get out of it. It&rsquo;s difficult to break out of it, and to try and rationalize inside of my head that this isn&rsquo;t normal. Adults don&rsquo;t act like teenagers in front of their parents because they want to try and get &ldquo;one more game in&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s not how it works. That&rsquo;s being a glorified man-child, and I&rsquo;ve found myself becoming than more and more as time goes on without fixing the root of the problem, being my relation with what stims me.</p>
