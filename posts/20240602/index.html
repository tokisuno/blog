<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I have a YouTube addiction. I continue relapsing and it&rsquo;s a problem. So what better way to solve it than develop a system that makes going on YouTube harder than before! This is a short guide on how you too can minimize your YouTube consumption with basic command-line tools and some patience. The process outlined</p>
<h1 id="addiction-is-hard-you-arent-alone">Addiction is hard (You aren&rsquo;t alone)</h1>
<p>You must remember that when breaking a bad habit or addiction, you must go easy on yourself. Don&rsquo;t be so lax that you relapse and stop caring again, but have some self-respect and compassion for yourself. It&rsquo;s going to be a long journey and constantly having shame about your habit isn&rsquo;t going to change anything. It&rsquo;ll make things worse.</p>
<h1 id="newsboat">Newsboat</h1>
<h2 id="what-the-hell-is-a-newsboat">What the hell is a newsboat?</h2>
<p>Newsboat is a free and open-source CLI RSS reader. It uses the vim-keys, very minimal, and very nice.</p>
<h2 id="my-newsboat-usage">My Newsboat usage</h2>
<p>Say I have an idea of what kind of YouTube video I want to watch, but I also keep on saving videos to my &ldquo;watch later&rdquo; playlist. At the moment I have over 600 videos in that playlist that I haven&rsquo;t touched, nor do I remember even adding. So instead I&rsquo;ve started curating two different playlists that I create during these moments of YouTube consumption. On top of that, there are creators that I enjoy watching and being up-to-date with, but hate trying to find them in my YouTube feed. Maybe they haven&rsquo;t uploaded? Maybe their video doesn&rsquo;t reach my sub box? This is all solved by using RSS.</p>
<h1 id="youtube-restriction">YouTube Restriction</h1>
<h2 id="df-youtube">DF YouTube</h2>
<p>If your relationship with YouTube isn&rsquo;t that bad and just want to remove some features from the website, DF YouTube is a great add-on I use on Firefox which hides things like my homepage and recommended videos tab. It saves a lot (and I mean a lot) of time in the long run.</p>
<h2 id="delete-the-apps">DELETE THE APPS!</h2>
<p>Deleting the YouTube app is a crucial step that cannot be avoided when trying to break this addiction. Apps are created for you to doom-scroll and spend as much time as possible in them. Advertisers are investors, and you&rsquo;re just a dollar sign to them. If you want to have any semblance of control, you&rsquo;re going to have to take back what&rsquo;s yours.</p>
<h2 id="blocksite">Blocksite</h2>
<p>This is something new that I&rsquo;ve started using. It&rsquo;s a free app on iOS which allows you to block websites from being accessed on your phone. It doesn&rsquo;t block the apps from being opened and used, but restricts how you access them from the web. Establishing this boundary is essential in my opinion. This can be done with any website blocker on any app store that you use. I use this one because it&rsquo;s free and does what I need it to do. It&rsquo;s like editing your /etc/hosts file but on you iPhone.</p>
<h2 id="leechblock">LeechBlock</h2>
<p>Leechblock is a Firefox extension that I use in order to block websites for specific periods of time. As we can see in my Leechblock config, I have all these sites blocked for most of the day. I disabled the ability to use &ldquo;override&rdquo; so that I don&rsquo;t have the temptation to peek while working. That leads to more doom-scrolling and then self-loathing, that is &ndash; if you have a bad relationship with your inner-self. But that builds during the rehabilitation process, so don&rsquo;t try to make any exceptions like this super early on. I also keep my redirect website to the nytimes games so I don&rsquo;t forget to do the daily wordle LMFAO.</p>
