<h1 id="not-clickbait-real">Not clickbait (real)</h1>
<p>There are going to be quite a few changes to the &ldquo;tokisuno&rdquo; brand (which feels weird and cringe to say since I am a small creator), so I wanted to announce some of what to expect in the future. I am not quitting, nor am I removing the blog entirely. I am just shifting the public repo somewhere else so I can use the domain for my portfolio.</p>
<h2 id="whats-poppin">What&rsquo;s poppin?</h2>
<h3 id="shift-in-focus">Shift in focus</h3>
<p>I am learning web development and want to have a landing page that acts like a resume of sorts. So when people search me up online, I don&rsquo;t want my domain to link DIRECTLY to my blog. That feels kind of personal. That&rsquo;s why this is probably going to move to something like <a href="https://tokisuno.rocks/blog">https://tokisuno.rocks/blog</a> or something of the sort. Aside from that, everything else stays pretty much the same.</p>
<h3 id="more-frequent-uploads">More frequent uploads</h3>
<p>Speaking of videos, I remember making videos when I first started and all I tried to do was upload biweekly, and that was really fun for me. I was just keeping myself sane while also expressing myself creatively. Now I have a pretty good outlet of express with my guitar, and I&rsquo;ve gotten pretty decent at it. But creative expression isn&rsquo;t a zero-sum game where you can only do one or the other, so I am bringing back bi-weekly uploads. I have the time and the want, so why not?</p>
<h3 id="what-happened-to-linguistics">What happened to Linguistics?</h3>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the elephant in the room. I think Linguistics is really useful and I think it should be mandatory in our public education system, but at the moment I don&rsquo;t really feel like I want to do anything Linguistics related. The thing that interested me the most was Theoretical Syntax but after further investigation and facing the hard facts, I came to the conclusion that it wouldn&rsquo;t be worth it, which sucks. I really enjoy it but I see no real world benefit in this Chomskian-way of hard-forming language when it&rsquo;s based a lot of non-falsifiable claims along and a lot of literature feels incomplete or wishy-washy. It&rsquo;s new, and I get that, but I wanted to use it to make something in the world. As it stands, Computational Linguistics functions on its own paradigm for language generation, one that my theoretical field isn&rsquo;t compatible with. If somehow a professor of mine reads this, if I am completely wrong you are free to contact me anywhere you can. I don&rsquo;t hate theoretics, I just want to develop another skill that will make me guaranteed money, and maybe come back in the future depending on the look of things.</p>
<p>Linguistics is really broad (like, really broad) so I can see myself being in some sort of Linguistics-like field in the future. I don&rsquo;t think my degree was a waste and I don&rsquo;t have any hard feelings towards anyone in my department. I just want to see some sort of reward for my hard work and finding a job with my BA feels near impossible, even when comparing it to the hard job marking web developers are dealing with at the moment.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s really all what&rsquo;s going to change. Once I learn more advanced CSS and HTML templating, I will most likely write the theme for this blog from scratch. I like web dev. I will upload more. Linguistics is cool. Programming is cool. Yeah. Swag.</p>
