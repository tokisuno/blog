<p>For those who are unaware, I had a reading goal for this year of 35 minutes. Now, the year hasn&rsquo;t ended yet so I can still make it back, but I want to make it clear that I am not sad or disappointed in myself. This post isn&rsquo;t to make excuses for myself because quite frankly, I feel really good about this year so far! I still have a physical illness that affects me daily, so audio content has helped me through a lot. I have been listening to a lot more podcasts and live-plays these days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve listened to a lot of Dungeons and Daddies, The Yard, and a few audiobooks. I&rsquo;ve liked them. A lot. I am pretty happy overall. Videos will come soon, but when I am comfortable. It looks fun. I am pushing this out just to push it out and so people know that I am still alive LOL. That&rsquo;s really it. You guys are pretty cool :)</p>
