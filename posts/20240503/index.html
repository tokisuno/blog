<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been following me for any amount of time, you would have noticed that although I do stream semi-consistently, I am active on my server, and I am active on my goodreads, I still don&rsquo;t really upload that much. I have some videos that have done pretty well, and I have other videos ideas, some of which I have held off for 2 years. &ldquo;So why is that?&rdquo; you may be wondering to yourself. The answer to that is a lot easier than it seems, and I&rsquo;ve been ashamed to say this for a long time.</p>
<h1 id="procrastination">Procrastination</h1>
<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>I have fallen back into quite a few bad habits, and they&rsquo;re mainly internal. These habits are habits of the mind, thought traps that I get stuck in that affect me externally. They manifest in procrastination and stem from perfectionism. They are rooted in insecurity that I had once destroyed but came out of the wood work due to unforeseen circumstances. It&rsquo;s all in my head, and I know it. They&rsquo;re all caused my external things that aren&rsquo;t in my power to control or fix, and trying to brute-force improvement while adhering to the restrictions of my mind is like trying to run up a steep sand dune in runners &ndash; you can run up the hill, but it will be significantly harder than running up barefoot or by simply walking around it.</p>
<h2 id="grateful">Grateful</h2>
<p>What I am about to say isn&rsquo;t in any way meant to stroke my ego. I don&rsquo;t think super highly of myself but I know what I am worth. But I also do believe that I am not that much different from everyone else. I am just a guy who decided during covid to make a YouTube channel like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2WwwZpcYiNdC27qAsWnS1g">smart tokki</a>. That turned into me becoming somewhat of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jvscholz">jvscholz</a> clone since I ended up really enjoying his old-tech aesthetic. I gained somewhat of a small following of about 1.58k subscribers and a Discord server of over 100 people &ndash; a feat I have never accomplished before. I ended up doing an &ldquo;interview&rdquo; with James some time later and through that, more eyes came to my channel. On top of that, another video of mine about tech blew up a bit. Both of those videos are my two highest performing videos every month. I am perfectly content with the amount of views I get too.</p>
<p>I am very grateful to be where I am right now. I am not big enough to have obsessive haters (but I do get the occasional bigoted/ignorant hate common), but I am not big enough to have a super big following from all over the world. I am not big enough to be recognized in the streets of my city, and I like that. It&rsquo;s comfortable. I don&rsquo;t make any money from content creation, nor do I receive any sponsorships of any kind.</p>
<h2 id="pressure">Pressure</h2>
<p>A wise Super Smash Brothers Melee commentator/legend <a href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/Smasher:YungWaff">Waff</a> once said &ldquo;Pressure makes Diamonds, Bobby&rdquo;, and that&rsquo;s stuck with me for a while. But I fell off of thinking about it due to external reasons. Although I had a system that once worked for me, I wanted to push out things that showed results, that showed that I was working on things and that progress was being made. I then started to doubt my own process, and fell into a state of perfectionism. <em>No one can see what I am doing until it is complete perfect because imperfection is wrong and bad and ugly</em>. That&rsquo;s been my on-going line of thinking for the past 5-7 months, and until recently it was at its worse. The problem doesn&rsquo;t lie in the pressure itself; the problem lies in how you deal with the pressure.</p>
<p>Due to the numbers rising with my channel, along with the attention growing, I get more anxious as time goes on. These arbitrary numbers which signify &ldquo;relevance&rdquo; or &ldquo;clout&rdquo; don&rsquo;t mean much, but they mean something to other people. It&rsquo;s the trap of thinking about what others <strong>might</strong> be thinking about you in that moment, or what people <strong>would</strong> think about you under X or Y circumstances. Notice the bold letters and try to see the correlation.</p>
<p>The correlation is that the things being talked about haven&rsquo;t happened, and there&rsquo;s no concrete evidence to support them at all. I can&rsquo;t read minds, and so can&rsquo;t you. But I remember being a shithead kid thinking lower of YouTubers if they didn&rsquo;t have a certain subscriber:view ratio. I remember talking shit about other channels thinking I was hot shit so whenever I see my own content, I look at it from the young bully-toki perspective instead of the mature-toki one.</p>
<h2 id="fear">Fear</h2>
<p>I am afraid of having a video flop. I am afraid of having a video that people don&rsquo;t want to see. I am afraid of not meeting the needs of the people who watch my videos. I am afraid of not telling the story I want to tell. I am afraid of being misunderstood or my words being used against me. I am afraid of being misinterpreted and manipulated. I am afraid of losing control of my channel and content. I am afraid of letting down those who watch my content and enjoy my personality. But I feel like I am enabling this the more I make &ldquo;study youtuber&rdquo; content. I have hobbies and interests that I have been meaning to make videos on for a long time, but I have been afraid to make anything in fear of alienating a part of my audience that came from both the James and Thinkpad wave. I am more than just those two videos, and I am more than just being another &ldquo;thinkpad guy&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s the fear of losing my identity while also actively suppressing the expression of my identity. I look back at my older videos sometimes and see how active and expressive I was, how happy I looked to be even making videos in the first place. I didn&rsquo;t care. But I started caring, and I started caring too much, and I started caring about the wrong things.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a kid. I&rsquo;m 22, afraid of what the future holds, and afraid of losing my identity. I have struggled with my identity and impostor syndrome for a good portion of my life, and I am still getting over it. The point of this post is to be transparent about what I am feeling with the channel, and to reassure that I am not going to abandon uploading altogether. It&rsquo;s taking some time, but I will get there again. I know I will, because I&rsquo;ve done it time and time again. Pressure makes diamonds, and I won&rsquo;t break under my own pressure this time. If I do, it&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ll get back up and try again. I can&rsquo;t quit now. I don&rsquo;t want to quit. No more running away from opportunities.</p>
