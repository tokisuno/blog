<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Well this was supposed to be out earlier this week, but quite frankly I forgot and was really tired from the weekend of gaming I just had.</p>
<h1 id="goml-forever">GOML Forever</h1>
<p>GOML is a yearly Super Smash Brothers Melee tournament I go to, and it&rsquo;s honestly one of my highlights of every year. I love GOML. It has done so much for me. I&rsquo;ve met many cool people going to the tournament, I&rsquo;ve seen many iconic moments in person, and I&rsquo;ve met a lot of the people I&rsquo;ve looked up to. I&rsquo;ve somehow managed to be a small part of a smaller community that I hold so dearly to my heart. For the past two years, I have been volunteering at the event helping run pools (sections of a double elimination bracket) and it&rsquo;s always really fun. I do obviously have moments where I fall behind schedule and sometimes that&rsquo;s just out of my content (infinite floaties being sent to my pool) and honestly that&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s all part of the experience. I love Melee and I love gaming. I love the environment. In person gaming is something you have to experience if you never have before. It&rsquo;s like live sporting but nerdier and depending on the scene, smellier. I am glad to say that the Melee community does a pretty good job with personal hygiene and I did not have a single sweaty-smelling person experience the entire event.</p>
<h1 id="troubles-with-aiming">Troubles with aiming</h1>
<p>I know this isn&rsquo;t going to be an issue for long, but I have a really hard time with being consistent with my aim, and it&rsquo;s actually out of my control. It isn&rsquo;t the muscle issues I have in my right arm. It&rsquo;s the humidity during the summer. For those who don&rsquo;t live in a humid country, humidity actually affects the feeling of your mousepad pretty significantly depending on the severity. The summer here gets very (very) hot, and since I&rsquo;m surrounded (and live near) many of the great lakes, it makes walking outside sometime feel like swimming through air. It&rsquo;s terrible. So I cannot for the LIFE of me get a consistent feeling of my mousepad. It feels like at times there&rsquo;s a ball underneath, or that there&rsquo;s a lot of resistance against it. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m fighting my mousepad in order to aim. It&rsquo;s really frustrating.</p>
<h1 id="two-time-blocks-a-day">Two time-blocks a day</h1>
<p>I am experimenting now (starting today) with strict time blocking. Not verbose intense time blocking however. Just two blocks. One for more focused study time, and the other for relaxation time. I have a problem with starting things at the beginning of the day and then figuring out when it&rsquo;s time to game. Right now I go to sleep pretty late. When I wake up early like I used to, I actually feel like complete trash. I have bad acid reflux, and it feels like the pores in my body are going to explode from the bloat. When I get up later, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<h1 id="making-videos-is-hard">Making videos is hard</h1>
<p>I have written some more scripts to record. I just have to reinstall Davinci, and I&rsquo;m off to the races again. I&rsquo;ve been feeling like absolute horseshit thinking about making videos again. I don&rsquo;t have anything to show for my time away. I know it&rsquo;s fine either way, as I don&rsquo;t do this for the income. I don&rsquo;t make income really. I loved sharing things, it&rsquo;s just that I don&rsquo;t feel like anything I have right now is worth sharing. It&rsquo;s this inferiority complex I have. I&rsquo;m also perfectionistic making it fucking IMPOSSIBLE to actually push things out to the public, and since I haven&rsquo;t been programming or sharing things on GitHub, it&rsquo;s gotten worse.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>See you guys next week ! :3</p>
