<h1 id="perfectionist">Perfectionist</h1>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t used to be this hard to release content, but I&rsquo;ve made the decision to upload this Thursday for the sole reason of &ldquo;fuck it&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m holding myself back out of my own perfectionist mindset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t used to be this way.</p>
<h1 id="the-past">The past</h1>
<p>Something that I do way too much, much more than I&rsquo;d like to admit, is think about the past. The past has already happened, and it&rsquo;s something I can&rsquo;t change. That&rsquo;s the truth. I can&rsquo;t go back and change the past, but I can use the past to influence how I make choices in the future, and the truth is I think I was a lot cooler when I started making content than how I am now. Sure, my mindset and mentality wasn&rsquo;t the most healthy and sustainable for the long term, but I was making things that I thought were cool, and I was getting recognition for it. I was being rewarded through being connected with people I wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise have been connected to. It was satisfying, and I was making content that although I think was &ldquo;lazy&rdquo;, it was authentic. I would talk more about my mentality, my outlooks on life, and my philosophies.</p>
<h1 id="figuring-things-out">Figuring things out</h1>
<p>But I haven&rsquo;t recently for a multitude of reasons, with the main one being I am still figuring shit out. It isn&rsquo;t easy being diagnosed with a chronic disorder, living in uncertainty over what&rsquo;s going on with your body for over a year, trying to pull yourself out of whatever hole you dug for yourself. There are a lot of things that I am learning about, but they&rsquo;re still too new and fresh. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I can&rsquo;t make videos about other things.</p>
<p>The honest truth is I am a hobbyist. That shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise to anyone. But I don&rsquo;t want to fall victim to making low-effort gear-slop setup videos. I find that there is a lot of software I use that would be fun to show off, but the videos won&rsquo;t be long enough.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the biggest struggle I&rsquo;m having with content. I don&rsquo;t want to make super short content, but honestly most of the videos I want to make can either be shorter more though-out blog posts or a shorter video that idk how well it will do. But that&rsquo;s the PROBLEM. Why do I care how well the video does if I didn&rsquo;t care while I was getting my first 1000 suscribers?</p>
<h1 id="caring-about-metrics">Caring about metrics</h1>
<p>Now HERE is the main underlying issue. Not to diminish everything else, but there&rsquo;s this impostor syndrome I have with myself where I feel like I don&rsquo;t deserve anything I have in life and that I am fake and a failure and blah blah blah. Cringe. But also metrics are so easy to get sucked into. I just have to suck it up and make content that a) I would watch, and b) that are about things I find genuinely interesting. Metrics only tell a little bit of the story, and how well a video does over a short period of time doesn&rsquo;t dictate how well it does in the long term. I also think that there&rsquo;s a lot to improve with my videos, especially as of recent. My set design is really bad. My room and vibe is lifeless; it&rsquo;s like I am living in a dungeon LMAO. So that&rsquo;s all to change.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re turning this ship around and heading straight for our original destination; I&rsquo;m going to make content that I actually care about without even considering the metrics. Fuck YouTube and the addictive numbers (I&rsquo;m just an addict, but let&rsquo;s just ignore that for now&hellip;)</p>
