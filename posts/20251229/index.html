<p>We&rsquo;re finally nearing the end of 2025 and going into the big 2026. Holy moly. If I am being completely honest, I didn&rsquo;t expect to make it this far. I didn&rsquo;t expect to live this far for that matter. If you asked 17/18 year old toki if he could imagine himself living past 18, he would have said no. Yet, here I am once again, at another years end, looking back and reflecting on what has happened.</p>
<p>I want to say first and foremost <em>thank you</em> to everyone that has supported me throughout this year. Through thick and thin, I know I am probably one of the most frustrating people to deal with. But I greatly appreciate all the love and support I&rsquo;ve received over the year from friends, family, and complete strangers over the internet.</p>

<h2 id="youtube">YouTube</h2>
<p>Funnily enough, (To give a little spoiler) I am actually filming a video of me cleaning up my room, which is something I have been putting off for the past 2 years. Throughout all the setup changes I&rsquo;ve made, this computer room is still in absolute disarray. It&rsquo;s been taking me literal days to film this because I&rsquo;ve been both tired and busy from work, and the mornings haven&rsquo;t been treating me super nicely (partially my fault). But we&rsquo;re still chugging along. Being completely transparent here; I having a lot of fun filming this video. I know that editing this is also going to be a blast. I like being goofy and unscripted a lot more than recording a scripted video. I think that&rsquo;s what makes me a good streamer and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve been able to put that into a video format much throughout the past 2 years.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to put a goal on this year for the content, since I now have other aspirations and goals I want to reach that have higher priority than content creation. But I think that&rsquo;s what I need. In order for me to excel with content, I have to do it when I want to when I have something I want to share with the world. I&rsquo;ve put a lot of pressure on myself over the past year to make something of myself, and that&rsquo;s gotten me nowhere. Now that I have some form of income, and a goal for life outside of YouTube, I have found myself being a lot more creative than I have been over the past year.</p>
<h2 id="music-creation">Music Creation</h2>
<p>I think I said I was going to release an album this year? That didn&rsquo;t happen simply because I don&rsquo;t really have all the songs I want to make it something worth publishing. It&rsquo;s just a normal accoustic album with some more personal songs, and I have teased some of it on my Instagram (same handle). But yeah, I just want to continue playing guitar like I have been for the most part. I never really started playing guitar with the main goal of being a super great guitar player. I just want to be able to play what I want to play and sing along with it. For most of my life, I&rsquo;ve wanted to make music content and covers but haven&rsquo;t been able to since not every song under the earth has a &ldquo;karaoke&rdquo; version or an &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; version. I also listen to a bunch of niche shit that DEFINITELY doesn&rsquo;t have any form of cover, so picking up an instrument for myself to solve my own problem has been a form of escaping and overall it&rsquo;s just a very fun hobby to have :)</p>
<h1 id="signing-off-for-now">Signing off for now</h1>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get 1 more video by the end of the year GUARANTEED, but this is going to be the last time I&rsquo;m writing in the blog for the year. I honestly write in here thinking that no one reads it, but then once in a while someone messages me about it and I&rsquo;m honestly surprised. Thank you for supporting me. Thank you for your kind words and messages. Expect great things for tokisuno &gt;:)</p>
<p>~ Lucas</p>
